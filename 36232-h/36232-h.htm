<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>A clatter of hoofs on the gravel of
the driveway. A shout from the rider
as he swung himself down from the saddle:</p>

<p>"Lou!"</p>

<p>A woman came swiftly from the cool shadows
of the porch into the brilliance of the
summer sunlight, to meet the man who now
advanced toward her with fond, smiling
eagerness.</p>

<p>The two kissed very tenderly, for they were
lovers still, after seven years of married life.
The delicate rose of the wife's cheeks deepened
a little under the warmth of the husband's
caress, and the graciously curving lips
trembled to a smile of happiness as she looked<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
up into the strong face of the man she loved.
In the slightly rugged features, she read virility
and honesty and loyalty. An exquisite
contentment pervaded her. She felt that the
cup of joy was brimming. Husband and
child and home&mdash;!</p>

<p>Her train of thought was broken by the
man's words, spoken quickly in a tone that
mingled curiously amusement and chagrin:</p>

<p>"Dangerous Dan! He's coming, Lou!
He's buried the hatchet, and is coming to visit
us. Dangerous Dan McGrew! Now, what
do you think of that?" He waited for an answer,
staring quizzically into the suddenly
perturbed face of his wife.</p>

<p>"My rival!" he added whimsically, albeit a
bit complacently.</p>

<p>"Never!" the wife declared with emphasis.
A note of harshness had crept into the music
of her voice. "Never your rival, Jim, though
he tried to be." The earnestness of utterance
gratified the man, in whom a vague, latent
jealousy stirred at thought of that other who
had loved where he loved. But there was no<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
gratification in the new mood of the woman.
Instead, a subtle dread touched her spirit.
The contentment of a moment before was fled.
There was nothing precise, nothing formulated,
in her thoughts. Only, something sinister,
menacing, pressed upon her. She
welcomed the distraction afforded by her
daughter's appearance on the scene.</p>

<p>The girl came running from the gardens
behind the ranch-house and sprang into her
father's arms with a cry of delight.</p>

<p>To her six years, his frequent rides to the
village ten miles away were in the nature of
great events, and she welcomed each return as
if from long and perilous voyaging. Moreover,
there was always an added thrill for
Nell in her father's home-coming, because of
the mysterious charm in the gift that never
failed. To-day, indeed, the present was destined
to mark her life; even to be of vital import
in a crisis of distant years.</p>

<p>No hint of the gravity of things-to-be shadowed
the radiant joy of the child's face, as she
was lifted in the man's arms and kissed.<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
There was only vivid anticipation of the gift
that would mark this wonderful hour.</p>

<p>James Maxwell lowered his daughter to the
ground, with an affirmative nod toward his
wife.</p>

<p>"Now, Nell," he said in a voice of authority,
"stand perfectly still, and keep your eyes
shut, and maybe something will happen."</p>

<p>The girl rested uneasily in an effort of
obedience, with her eyes screwed tight-shut,
giggling expectantly.</p>

<p>The mother looked on, smiling again, the
momentary depression of her spirit allayed, if
not destroyed, by the scene. She met the
man's glance with understanding in the
brown, gold-flecked deeps of her eyes. The
father took from a pocket a small leather case,
and opened it, and held up for his wife's inspection
the gold chain and pendant locket,
set with an initial <i>N</i> in tiny pearls. The
wife nodded her approval. Straightway, the
chain was adjusted about the child's neck,
with the locket hanging low on the slender
breast.<span class="pagenum">[11]</span></p>

<p>"Now!" the father cried sternly.</p>

<p>On the instant, Nell's dark eyes flashed
open in swift inquiry to her father's face,
then, following the direction of his gaze, the
proud chin was drawn in, and she stared down
rapturously at the trinket lying on her bosom.
Followed little squeals of bliss, then reverent
touching of the treasure. The secret of the
catch baffled her, and the father had to come
to the rescue lest patience become too hardly
strained. When the locket had been opened,
she stared into it through long seconds in
wordless pleasure. Finally, she spoke in a
hushed voice, as if in the presence of something
very sacred.</p>

<p>"It's you, Daddy!" It was a broken whisper
of happiness. Her eyes, lustrous with
glad tears, were lifted adoringly to her father's
face for a moment. Then, again, her
glance went to the locket.</p>

<p>"And you, Mamma!" she exclaimed, and
turned to regard her mother with equal love.
"Oh, it's just beautiful! Pictures of both of
you&mdash;Daddy and Momsy!&mdash;all my very own!...<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
And may I really, truly wear it?"
Nell's voice was suddenly become timid, infinitely
wistful.</p>

<p>The mother answered, as she stooped and
kissed her daughter.</p>

<p>"Yes, darling; it's all your very own, to
wear every minute, day and night, if you want
to."</p>

<p>Presently, when the intricacy of the locket's
catch had been fully mastered, Nell stole away
to her favorite shady nook in the rose-garden,
to be alone with her delight, while husband
and wife ascended the steps of the porch, and
seated themselves at ease in the wicker chairs.
The lattice-work of vines shut off the rays
of the westering sun. Blowing over the
stretches of lawn, thick-set with shrubberies
and studded with trees, the soft breeze came refreshingly,
and bore to the two the multiple
bland aromas of the generous earth. Beyond
the green within which the mansion stood,
rolled rich acres of ripening grain that undulated
beneath the gentle urging of the wind<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
in shimmering waves of gold. The whole
scene was one of peace and prosperity, where
a fruitful soil lavished riches in return for the
industry of man. The house itself was a commodious
structure, bountifully equipped with
the comforts and elegancies of living; for
James Maxwell was, though still a young
man, one who had achieved a full measure of
success from out the fertile fields of the West,
and his culture and that of his wife had given
to their home a refinement unusual in regions
so remote. Thus far, their married life had
been almost flawless. The wholesomeness and
simplicity of their life together, blessed with
the presence of the child, varied by occasional
visits to the larger centers of civilization, had
held them in tranquil happiness. Yet, this
afternoon, there lacked something of the accustomed
serenity between the two. Now,
the oppression that had affected the woman at
the mention of Dan McGrew returned to her
in some measure, and, by reason of the sympathy
between her and him, a heaviness<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
weighed on his mood as well, though he concealed
it as best he might, even from himself,
and spoke with brisk cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"Yes, Lou, Dangerous Dan McGrew is
about to descend upon us&mdash;handsome as ever,
I suppose, and with all his wiles still working.
I can't cease to wonder, Lou, how I ever came
to win you from him." There was a new tenderness
in his voice as he spoke the final words.</p>

<p>The wife laughed softly.</p>

<p>"Don't fish, Jim," she retorted. "You
know perfectly well that Dan never had a
chance with me&mdash;not really. He was always
a fascinating fellow enough, but, somehow&mdash;"
She fell silent, a puzzled frown lining the
warm white of her forehead beneath its coronal
of golden hair.</p>

<p>"Yes," the husband agreed; "somehow,
there is always that 'but' when one gets to
thinking of Dan." He would have added
more, but checked himself, reluctant to speak
ill of one who had been his friend, one whom
he had bested in the struggle for a woman's
favor.<span class="pagenum">[15]</span></p>

<p>The wife had no such scruple. She spoke
incisively, and her voice was harsher than its
wont.</p>

<p>"I never trusted him," she said. "I always
found myself doubting his honesty."</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Jim spoke his mind
frankly.</p>

<p>"Dan was always as crooked as a dog's hind
leg," he declared, without any trace of bitterness,
but as one stating a fact not to be denied.</p>

<p>"He wrote to you?" Lou inquired, with a
suggestion of wondering in her voice.</p>

<p>"No; it was Tom."</p>

<p>Jim thrust his hand into the breast-pocket
of his coat, and brought forth an envelope,
from which he took out and unfolded a single
sheet of typewritten paper. Then he read
the letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="salutation">Dear old Chum:</p>

<p>"Dan McGrew is back again in his old
home after five years. He is coming down to
see you and his old sweetheart, Lou. He has
not yet forgiven you for winning her. He
seems to have the same old unsettled disposition<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
and I think he requires the strong hands
of a friend to keep him in the straight path.</p>

<p class="author">"Sincerely your old friend,</p>

<p class="signature">"<span class="smcap">Tom</span>."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Then you don't know when he will get
here?" Lou asked.</p>

<p>Jim shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said, rather irritably; "we'll just
have to wait for the visitation to descend upon
us, be it sooner or later."</p>

<p>"We shall have to be nice to him, of course,"
the wife said.</p>

<p>"I'm not specially keen on dry-nursing Dan
McGrew," Jim remarked plaintively. "We
were never really intimate, though we were
friendly enough. To tell the truth, Lou, I'm
mighty sorry Dan's coming here." His face
was somber as he gazed into his wife's eyes
and read in their clear light sympathy with
his own repugnance at the prospect. With an
impatient ejaculation, he sprang to his feet
and went into the house, where he seated himself
before the grand piano that occupied the<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
center of the spacious living-room. In a
fierce crashing of dissonances, he voiced the
resentment that was in him. But after a little,
indignation somewhat relieved by such audible
interpretation, his fingers flew into rippling
arpeggios, out of which came, at last, a
lilting melody, joyous, yet tender. For Jim
Maxwell, lover of music all his days, had a
gift of improvisation, with a sufficient technique
for its exercise. To it he resorted often
for the sounding of his deeper moods, and in
it found a never-failing solace. So now, presently,
soothed by his own art, he got up from
the piano and went back to the porch, where
he faced his wife, smiling.</p>

<p>Lou smiled in response.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jim," she said softly. "You
scared away all the blue devils with those
dreadful discords. And then you just tempted
all sorts of good fairies to come and hover, and
they did. You cheered me up. It's all right
that Dan should come to visit us. Only&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off, nor did the husband utter any<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
question as to the uncompleted sentence. But
in the hearts of both lurked still something of
the dread which the music had failed entirely
to dispel.<span class="pagenum">[19]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>The time of Dan McGrew's arrival was
not long left in doubt; for, on the third
day following Tom's letter, Jim received one
from Dan himself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="salutation">Dear Jim:</p>

<p>Am back again in the old home after five
years, and have grown rich. Am coming
right down to see you and my old sweetheart,
Lou. I can still hardly forgive you for winning
her from me, but I suppose you're the
better man. I am still the same rolling stone,
ever seeking the gold that seems to get further
away as I approach. Will reach your place
the Tuesday following your receipt of this
letter.</p>

<p class="author">Sincerely,</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">Dan McGrew</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, on the appointed Tuesday, Jim drove
in his light, covered buggy to the town, to
meet the through train from the East. With
him, mounted on her pony, went Nell. She<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
wore the precious locket proudly displayed
against her trim khaki coat, and she rode in
happy excitement, for the trip to her was a
great adventure, and there was, in addition,
the thrilling novelty of this stranger's coming,
who might be a prince in disguise.</p>

<p>When, at last, the limited roared into the
station at Coverdale, and Dan McGrew swung
himself down from the Pullman's steps, Jim
went forward and seized his visitor's hand in
a warm clasp.</p>

<p>"It's good to see you again, after all these
years," he cried heartily. At this moment,
there was only kindness in his feeling toward
the tall, handsome man who returned his
greeting so genially. He meant to be as
friendly as he could to this guest, to be helpful
and loyal, so far as he might, though the other
had no claim upon his friendship, and though
he himself had neither liking nor respect for
Dan McGrew.</p>

<p>After the first exchange of exclamations between
the two, Jim called to Nell, who had
remained standing diffidently at a little distance,<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
her deeply tanned face, under the dark
masses of hair, tense with interest, as her eyes
searched the newcomer in vast curiosity. A
great shyness was upon her as she approached.</p>

<p>"This is my daughter, Nell," Jim said, with
manifest pride in the winsome creature.</p>

<p>"And Lou's!" the other muttered, under his
breath. But Jim caught the words, and was
moved to a fleeting pity for the man who had
failed in love.</p>

<p>Nell murmured a stilted phrase in expression
of her pleasure at meeting Mr. McGrew.
But as the stranger bent and kissed her, she
felt a sudden instinct of distaste under the
caress that both frightened and puzzled her.
For, hitherto in her childish experience, embraces
and kisses had been matters either of
pleasure, as in the case of her father and
mother and others dear to her, or of utter indifference,
as in the case of those for whom she
cared nothing. Now, for the first time, a kiss
was disagreeable. She felt herself somehow
frightened by this fine gentleman, who might
be a prince. She could not understand it.<span class="pagenum">[22]</span></p>

<p>The child could not have understood even
had she been able to look into the heart of
Dangerous Dan McGrew, there to see the
black malice that fouled it.</p>

<p>For such was the fact. There was evil in
the mind and in the soul of Dan McGrew.
Through all the years since he had lost Lou
Ainsworthy, he had longed for her. The circumstance
that she was married to another
man put no curb on his fierce desire for her.
Unlawful passion throbbed in his blood. It
was this that had driven him to the long journey.
A man wholly without scruple, without
care for any other than himself, save only the
woman to possess whom he so craved, Dan
McGrew was resolved to woo that woman
anew, to win her for himself by any means, no
matter how false or vile.</p>

<p>Thus, it came to pass that, in the days of his
dwelling under the roof of the man whom he
was determined to wrong, the visitor played
the hypocrite with his host, aping a manner
of bluff, candid good-fellowship. With the
wife, too, he played the hypocrite. He dared<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
not let her so much as suspect the hot fires that
burned in him as he looked yearningly on her
loveliness. He realized, at the outset, that
her devotion to the man of her choice remained
unaltered. He knew that the open
confession of his illicit love would move her
to scorn and loathing. Only by guile, and
that of the craftiest, could he hope for triumph
over loyalty and love. With the passing
days, the task loomed before him as one
almost impossible of achievement. From all
that he knew of Jim's past life and all that he
could learn concerning the husband's reputation
in the community, there showed nowhere
any least opportunity for attack. And attack
must be made, for only by destroying the
wife's faith could he have any opportunity to
gain her favor. It occurred to him that, in
a conspiracy, he would have need of accomplices.
To get some information concerning
such as might serve his end, he often rode
alone to the town, while Jim was occupied
with ranch affairs. There, he entered easily
into the vulgar dissipations of the place, making<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
himself hail-fellow-well-met with the riff-raff
of the saloons and dance-houses, both men
and women. The occupation was, in truth,
congenial enough to him; for there was a
coarseness in his nature that found satisfaction
in loose living. Before he had been a week
at the ranch, he had become known to all the
blear-eyed habitu&eacute;s of Murphy's saloon&mdash;to
some of the women frequenters there as well,
and to certain men who were not blear-eyed;
for they drank little, but played poker much.
With these latter, especially, Dangerous Dan
fraternized, since, like many a wiser man and
better, he greatly admired poker&mdash;and his
own playing of it.</p>

<p>Dan won the first day, and the second, and
the third&mdash;as those playing with him meant
that he should. But the stakes were small.
Dan himself fretted because they were so
small. It was his own suggestion, his own insistence,
that the stakes should be raised. Immediately,
then, Dan's luck slumped. It
worried him only a little at first&mdash;more, as the
ill fortune continued.<span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>On the fourth day, Jess, one of the painted
women of the place, leaned over him so closely
that the heavy musk of her perfume deadened
his senses. She whispered her admiration of
his play. Dan forgot that she was the wife
without the law of Fingie Whalen, who sat
across the table from him, ferret-faced and
with slender, agile fingers that touched the
deck of cards always with the soft delicacy of
a caress. Jess's praise fattened Dan's pride in
his own skill. He insisted loudly on larger
stakes, which were accepted grudgingly by
his fellow players. There were four others
at the table with him. Despite his experience
in cities further East, he had no least suspicion
that the odds of the game were four to one.
He lost a most attractive pot on a full house
of kings with treys. The event angered him.
A little later, a pot that had been raised
around the board until it was of admirable
proportions, was lost by him to one who held a
humble, but efficient, flush.</p>

<p>Dan was not an honest man. His losses
irritated him. He believed, by reason of a<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
certain dexterity in legerdemain, that he could
thus cajole fortune. He misjudged his company.
When he possessed himself of four
aces, and held them concealed in his hand, he
failed to note the eyes of Fingie Whalen,
which had followed his every movement.</p>

<p>But this same Fingie, being a master of his
craft, said nothing until after the bets had run
high and it had come to the show-down. Dan
had forced the betting to a point where the
chips and bills and gold on the table totaled
a most respectable sum. He swept the pot
toward him, after a contemptuous glance at
the four-of-a-kind which Fingie had offered
against him. His own four aces were indisputably
winners.</p>

<p>But Fingie Whalen thrust out an imperative
hand in restraint.</p>

<p>"Nothin' doin'!"</p>

<p>In the same instant, his fingers closed in a
viselike grip on Dan's left hand. Dan was
the stronger man. But, in the moment of surprise,
his muscles yielded. His hand was
pulled forward&mdash;it lay open on the table.
<span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>

<p>Within his palm four cards were lying.
With his free hand Fingie flipped the four
cards upon the table. They were inconsiderable&mdash;a
deuce, a nine, a pair of sevens.</p>

<p>His trickery thus baldly revealed, Dan
would have acted, but he was too late. As he
pulled the automatic from his pocket, the man
next him thrust an elbow forward and the shot
went wild. In the next instant, the pistol had
been knocked from his grasp, and four men
bore down upon him. Dan was a strong man,
and, whatever his faults, absolutely fearless.
He struck out vigorously, but the slender, silk-ankled
foot of Jess caught him so that he
stumbled and missed his blow. The fists of
the four beat him to the floor.</p>

<p>It was then that Jim entered the room. He
had business in town, and, on learning at the
ranch-house that his guest had preceded him,
he had felt it incumbent upon him to seek out
Dan. He had acted from a rather futile sense
of duty toward the man who, as Tom had put
it, required the strong hands of a friend to
keep him in the straight path.
<span class="pagenum">[28]</span></p>

<p>At the hotel, he made inquiry of the clerk:</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything of Mr. McGrew?"</p>

<p>The clerk permitted himself an indulgent
grin at the question. He admired Jim Maxwell,
as did all the better element in the community,
and he found himself wondering over
the disreputable associations of the stranger
who was the ranch-owner's guest. His answer
was prompt:</p>

<p>"You're pretty sure to find him in the back
room over to Murphy's. Usually, when he
hits this burg, he sets in a game with the gang
over there."</p>

<p>Jim's face lined grimly. He felt a great
distaste for his mission. He was no precisian.
He was not above taking a glass on occasion
at Murphy's bar. But he had no liking for
the vicious. The coarse debauchery of such
a place was repulsive to him, as it must be to
any decent man. Nevertheless, he went out
of the hotel, and strode rapidly toward the
corner on which stood the rough frame building
of the saloon. As he drew near, the report
of a shot came sharply.
<span class="pagenum">[29]</span></p>

<p>"What hell's mess is on now?" he muttered
savagely, and broke into a run. In the next
instant, he had leaped through the door to the
back room. He could not see clearly for a
few seconds in the gloomy place, after the
glaring sunlight of outdoors. But the evidences
of conflict were plain enough from the
sounds of stamping boots upon the boarded
floor, the soft thudding of fists against flesh,
the snarling curses, gaspings and guttural
gruntings of the combatants, the shrill screams
and whimperings of women. Then his eyes
adjusted themselves to the dim light, and he
made out the form of Dan McGrew, girt
about with the thrashing arms and legs of
his assailants. Without any hesitation, Jim
plunged into the fray. His fists shot home in
sledge-hammer blows, against which the four,
taken completely by surprise, were defenseless.
As they fell away from their victim, Jim saw
the automatic lying where it had fallen on the
floor during the scuffle. Before his adversaries
could rally to the attack, he had pounced
upon it, and had sprung back against the wall
<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
of the room, whence he menaced the four, who
halted in fear of the weapon.</p>

<p>"There's been enough of this," Jim declared,
and his voice was ominous, heavy with authority.
"I don't know the rights of the fuss,
and I don't care a damn, I guess. But there'll
be no murder done here&mdash;unless it's been done
already."</p>

<p>There came some profane grumblings from
the discomfited quartette, but they ventured no
other opposition to Jim's will, for they feared
this man, and he knew it, and he did not fear
them in the least.</p>

<p>"We caught 'im cheatin'&mdash;blast 'im!" Fingie
affirmed, sullenly.</p>

<p>"I'm not interested in the history of the
row," was the contemptuous retort; "only in
the end of it." Jim thrust the revolver in his
pocket, assured that there would be no further
trouble; for now the bartender and Murphy
had made a belated appearance on the scene.
He stooped over the beaten man, who had already
begun to show signs of returning consciousness.
Presently, in fact, Dan was able
<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
to sit up, and to swallow the brandy Murphy
had brought. His injuries, though painful
enough, were superficial, and after a little he
was able to clamber into the buggy, which Jim
had hired from the hotel livery for the return
to the ranch.</p>

<p>They had gone a mile from the village,
when Dan spoke for the first time:</p>

<p>"It was all a devilish frame-up to rob me,"
he asserted. His tone was vindictive, but,
somehow, not quite convincing.</p>

<p>Jim could not keep the scorn from his own
voice as he answered:</p>

<p>"You can't complain&mdash;you knew what sort
they were."</p>

<p>Under the lash of justice in the taunt from
the man who had rescued him, Dan McGrew
was silent; but the black malice in his heart
seethed still more fiercely from quickened
fires of hate.
<span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>Jim explained the affair to Lou, with a bitter
emphasis that forbade questioning as
to details.</p>

<p>"Dangerous Dan," he said, unable to avoid
a sarcastic inflection on the adjective, "got
into a fight at Murphy's. When I arrived,
there were four on top of him."</p>

<p>"And you pulled them off, I suppose," Lou
said, her lips curving to a smile in which
amusement blended with admiration for the
stalwart man who had spoken so curtly.</p>

<p>"I can't say that I exactly pulled them off,"
Jim answered, with a faint responsive smile.
"Anyhow, I managed to get them off him, one
way or another. That's the reason he's here
now&mdash;worse luck!"</p>

<p>In the days that followed, Dangerous Dan
played the hypocrite to perfection. He went
no more to town. With Jim, he was all
<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
amiability, full of reminiscences concerning
the long-ago, when they had pranked together
in the devious ways of boys. Indeed, he was
so agreeable that Jim found himself at least
tolerant of the company of this guest, for
whom, without any obligation whatsoever, he
had assumed some measure of responsibility.
For he remembered always that phrase in the
letter Tom had written him: "And I think
he requires the strong hands of a friend to
keep him in the straight path." He felt an
onerous responsibility for the visitor whom
fate thrust upon him, though he detested that
responsibility&mdash;and the man.</p>

<p>It was the time of the harvest. Jim was
busy with overseeing a multitude of details
in the gathering of the crops. Often, he was
away from the house from dawn to dark.
Nell, too, was frequently absent, for she delighted
in the activities of men and horses and
machines in the fields. On her pony, she
spent hours in her father's company. The
consequence was that Dan McGrew enjoyed
unlimited opportunities of association with his
<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
host's wife. Necessarily, the intimacy of their
former relations had its effect on their present
intercourse. Indeed, Dan made a habit of
half-jesting, half-sentimental references to
that time when he had wooed so vainly. The
phrase was often on his lips:</p>

<p>"Do you remember, Lou, when we were
sweethearts&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Lou, for her part, undoubtedly found something
pleasant in the situation. Dan showed
himself at his best toward her. Since he
knew the utter hopelessness at this time of winning
her from her allegiance, he strove to hide
from her any expression of the passion that
burned within him, though the effort taxed
his strength of will to the utmost. But, because
of his restraint, Lou was unsuspicious as
to the visitor's designs, and accepted Dan's
proffer of innocent friendship. He was an
amiable and entertaining companion, an
agreeable variation from the somewhat monotonous
loneliness of the ranch-house; especially
at this season of the year, when husband
and daughter alike so constantly deserted her.
<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
Certainly, she knew that her guest was her
lover as well. But the fact did not militate
against him in her regard. On the contrary,
it gave piquancy to their companionship.
The unvarying manner of respect for her as
his friend's wife lulled suspicion. She sympathized
with him for his failure in attaining
the desire of his heart. A mild feminine
vanity found gratification in the presence of
one so humbly devoted. She had no shred of
liking for him, in any deeper sense. Sometimes,
indeed, of an evening, when the three
were together under the lights of the living-room,
she found herself comparing the two
men. She admitted that, in a superficial way,
Dan was perhaps the handsomer. His features
were as clearly cut as those of some
Roman emperor. The eyes, set wide-apart,
gave dignity to his expression. There was in
his air always a suggestion of ruthless strength,
even of lawlessness, as of one who would wreak
his will, reckless of consequence. It was that
quality which in his boyhood had won him the
name of Dangerous Dan. He had been given
<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
over to escapades, to exploits of daring
prowess, to fights against odds for the sheer
love of fighting. In bodily strength and the
usual manly qualities, the two men were well
matched. Lou could see little to choose between
them. But her comparison ended always
in a great welling of love for her husband.
There was in his expression a kindliness,
in no way weakness, that the other lacked.
And there was, too, something subtle, a quality
of the soul, to be felt, though not to be seen
or described, by those with whom he came in
contact. It occurred to Lou once, as she thus
meditated while the men talked together, that
Jim's love for music, together with his skill
in its interpretation, was characteristic of the
difference between the two; for to Dan,
though he was at times swayed easily and
deeply by music, the art meant little to him,
made no component part in his life.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, it was Jim's music that,
very directly, precipitated a crisis in the situation.
<span class="pagenum">[37]</span></p>

<p>It was a day of languorous heat from a sun
like molten brass. Jim, a little weary after
hours among his men, found an opportunity
for leisure, and welcomed it. He rode to the
ranch-house, and sighed gratefully as he
entered the cool-shaded porch, where he
found Lou busy with some sewing, while Dan
lounged at ease over a pipe. The wife welcomed
her husband gladly, and fussed over
him, and brought him lemonade. Jim was
listless at first from fatigue, and listened lazily
to the chatting of his wife and their guest,
without taking part. But presently, he felt
himself revived, and entered heartily into the
talk. Perceiving his increased animation,
Lou made a request.</p>

<p>"If you're not too tired, Jim," she said
eagerly, "I wish you would play over that
melody you worked out the day you received
Tom's letter. I do hope you remember it,"
she continued, with a little catch of anxiety
in her voice. "Bits of it have been running
in my head all day."
<span class="pagenum">[38]</span></p>

<p>Jim rose obediently, with a smile for his
wife. As their eyes met, Lou smiled mischievously.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, you will remember it began with
a great lot of startling chords. But you don't
need to repeat them."</p>

<p>Jim grinned appreciatively.</p>

<p>"I'm not in the mood for those chords, as
you politely term them, to-day. But I think
I have that song still in my head&mdash;and in my
heart." The last words were spoken softly.</p>

<p>From the living-room, a moment later,
came a ripping charm of arpeggios that in
their sequence told softly of the melody to
come. Then, soon, the air itself sounded in
its joyous, lilting rhythm of a passionate tenderness.</p>

<p>It was plain that the player was telling the
truth of his heart. The music made a rhapsody
of love. Deep within it was a whisper
of spiritual things, of things sacred. But,
too, the weaving notes made a mesh of sensuous
splendor. There was a voluptuous spell
in the throbbing cadences.
<span class="pagenum">[39]</span></p>

<p>It was the sensual witchery of the music
that probed the emotions of Dan McGrew,
and beat them to swirling revolt against the
calmness he had striven to maintain. The
finer, nobler meaning of the love-lyric touched
him not at all. But the sorcery of that exquisite
voluptuousness thrilled in his blood.
He sat watching the woman, and his eyes were
aflame. The enchantment of the melody was
upon her as well. Body and soul, she responded
in her mood to the mood of the
player, whom she loved, even as he loved her.
The oval of her cheeks bore a deepened rose.
The red curves of the lips bent to a tremulous
smile. The dark glory of her eyes shone
more radiantly, as she stared, unseeing, into
the distance. The lithe, gracious form was
become tense in this moment of absorbed feeling.
Never had Dan McGrew seen her so
wonderfully alive, so vibrant of emotion, so
beautiful, so desirable, so altogether adorable.
With the beat of the music lashing on desire,
the spectacle of the woman's loveliness fed
the flames of longing, until the fires of his
<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
passion consumed utterly the will that would
have held them in control. The music softened
at last to a mere breath of beautiful
sound. Then, a clangor of triumphant harmonies&mdash;and
silence.</p>

<p>Lou rose quickly, and went into the living-room.</p>

<p>In his fevered imagination, Dan McGrew
could see the caress between husband and
wife, and, though he continued to sit immobile,
staring dazedly at the spot where a moment
before the woman had been, wrath
surged in him against that other man. By so
much as his love for the woman welled in him,
by so much the tide of his hate mounted.
For a long time, he sat there, through ages of
torture, as it seemed to him. He heard Jim
go out of the house by the back way. Soon
afterward, there came to his ears the clatter
of a horse's hoofs on the gravel of the drive,
and he knew that the ranch-owner was off
again to the fields, though he did not look up
to see. With mad eagerness, he was awaiting
the woman's return. Reason no longer
<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
had any hold on his mood. He was helpless
in the clutch of passion. The music had
softened the fibers of resolve. The allurement
of the love-light that had shone from
Lou's face while she sat listening, had drawn
his desire of her into a vortex that held him
powerless against its rush. He had no plan
of action, no thought as to what his course
should be. He was conscious only of an intolerable
need of this woman. As the minutes
passed, and still she did not return, the
longing mastered him completely. He got
to his feet, with unaccustomed awkwardness,
and went into the living-room with shambling
steps wholly unlike his usual elastic tread.
He moved falteringly, as might one in the
dark in a strange place. For, in truth, the
mists of passion had settled on his spirit,
shrouding and blinding him.</p>

<p>Lou was reclining in a low easy chair,
within a nest of cushions. In the abandonment
of her posture, the suave grace of her
body's lines, still maidenly, rather than matronly,
despite her full womanhood, were
<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
clearly revealed to the man's avid eyes. On
her face was still the expression of rapturous
tenderness that was not for him, which, nevertheless,
had enthralled him. Dan McGrew,
in this hour of folly, was bereft of judgment
utterly. The woman there in the chair, who
did not even turn her head toward him as he
entered, was a loadstone that drew toward
her irresistibly every atom of the blood racing
in his veins. He went toward her&mdash;without
any hesitation or faltering now. All the
life in him seemed in this instant to be at its
best, potent as never before, and not to be denied.
So, he moved forward lightly and
swiftly. Before the woman had so much as
guessed his presence there beside her, he had
stooped and taken her in his arms.</p>

<p>Lou cried out sharply under the shock of
fear in the first second, when the man's arms
closed about her. But, in the next instant, as
she felt herself lifted bodily from her place,
and crushed against Dan's breast, a horrible
fear beset her that sapped her strength, and
left her limp within the fierce embrace. Her<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
face was suddenly become pallid. She was
half-swooning under the dreadfulness of the
thing that had befallen. Dan rained kisses on
the golden masses of her hair, from which the
delicate perfume penetrated his senses, and inflamed
him to new madness. He loosened his
clasp upon her body, in order to raise the
white face to his lips. But then, at last, the
energies of the woman were suddenly restored.
A hot flush of mingled shame and anger dyed
face and throat. The heavy lids lifted from
the dark eyes, which now were blazing. Her
body tensed, then writhed in an abrupt, violent
effort for freedom. Her action caught
the man unawares. She slipped from his
arms, and darted behind the chair in which
she had been sitting, so that its bulk was interposed
as a barrier between them.</p>

<p>"Oh, you have dared&mdash;!" She broke off,
choking over the humiliation of such an outrage
against her womanhood. She was pale
and flushed by turns. Her body was racked
by convulsive shudderings. She was wounded
to the depths of her being.<span class="pagenum">[44]</span></p>

<p>Dan, nevertheless, was without compunction
at sight of her distress. He was still
crazed by desire of her&mdash;a desire only intensified
a thousand-fold by that brief contact of
her within his arms. With a great leap, he
was upon her before she could flee again, had
caught her shoulder, wrenched her about, and,
for a second time, swung her to his breast.
The shriek she would have uttered was muffled
by his lips on her mouth.</p>

<p>Jim returned early from the fields that afternoon.
His heart was fairly singing with happiness,
as he mounted the steps of the house.
His love was overflowing. All things in life
were perfect to him. He halted on the
porch, somewhat surprised that neither Lou
nor their guest should be there. He chanced
to glance through the window into the living-room.
It was the very moment when Dan
McGrew held the woman strained to his
bosom, his mouth on hers. Jim stared, uncomprehending,
unbelieving. Then, horror
fell upon him, enveloped him in a black pall
of agony&mdash;for his wife lay supine, unresisting,<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
yielding to the kisses that polluted purity.
But, in another second, Lou found strength to
twist her lips aside, and the cry that had been
stifled broke from her. Its appeal was unmistakable
in its frantic suffering. Jim heard
and understood, and answered with a roar of
rage, as he hurled himself through the door
and upon the man who thus dishonored him.
Lou, released as Dan heard Jim's shout,
shrank away, and stood trembling against the
wall, while the two men reeled back and forth
in a frenzied grapple. Their strength was so
well matched that neither at the outset could
gain an advantage; for each was keyed to extreme
endeavor by the urge of elemental passions
at their full. Then, as their lurching
bodies sent a massive chair volleying to the
floor, Jim's hold was loosened. Dan had time
to snatch the automatic from his pocket&mdash;but
not time to use it. Before his arm could be
raised to fire, Jim had caught his wrist in a
grip not to be broken. A hip-lock threw Dan
backward violently against the table that stood
on one side of the room. Strong though it<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
was, the table yielded under the impact of the
two heavy bodies upon it, and went crashing
to the floor, with the two men atop the splintered
boards. The force of the fall stunned
Dan for a moment. The automatic dropped
from his released hand. Jim saw, and seized
the weapon. Ere Dan could move, he had
scrambled to his feet, where he stood menacing
the fallen man. Perhaps he would have
shot his enemy there and then&mdash;but Lou interposed.
She had watched with dilated eyes
the fight between the men who loved her.
Her whole feeling had been a desperate
prayer for her husband's victory: a prayer
made vital by hate against the man who had
so grossly insulted her. Now at the end,
however, a softer, feminine emotion compelled
her. She leaped forward, and clung
to her husband's arm.</p>

 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">THE TABLE WENT CRASHING TO THE FLOOR, WITH THE TWO MEN ATOP THE SPLINTERED BOARDS.</p>

<p>"No, no, Jim!" she implored him. "Don't
shoot! Tell him to go.... Oh, my God!
Tell him to go, Jim."</p>

<p>Dan clambered clumsily to his feet. The
muzzle of the automatic stared at him in vicious<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
threat of death. The issue had left him
helpless. He was too weak for further combat,
in the reaction from great emotions. He
stood with downcast eyes, swaying a little unsteadily.</p>

<p>Jim spoke, his voice metallic:</p>

<p>"You hear?" he said. "Get out of here, you
dog! I'll send your things to the hotel to-night.
Not a word out of you&mdash;damn you!&mdash;or
I'll kill you in your tracks."</p>

<p>Husband and wife stood rigidly motionless,
watching. The beaten man ventured no rebellion
against the decree. He went out of
the room with a stealthy, slinking haste, as
though he feared lest the self-restraint of his
victor might fail. But in his heart was
neither remorse nor despair&mdash;only a fiercer
hatred of the man, a fiercer love of the woman.<span class="pagenum">[48]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>On the porch, Dan caught up his hat,
which had been lying on the chair, and
hastened to the stables. He did not scruple
now to make use, for the journey to the village,
of the horse which he had been accustomed
to ride. As he trotted down the driveway,
he encountered Nell, mounted on her
pony. The girl's gypsy-like face was flushed
from a brisk canter under the hot sun, and her
black eyes shadowed by the long, curling
lashes, were sparkling with the joy of life.
She called out cheerily in inquiry whether her
father was at the house. Dan called a curt,
"Yes," in answer, without checking his pace.
But, as the two came abreast, the girl's glance
took in the haggard fury on the man's face,
and the fearfulness of it fell like a blight
on her gladness. She was terror-stricken,
without in the least understanding why. For
his part, Dan McGrew rode on his way
with an added curse for this innocent child.</p>


<p>Dan McGrew registered at the hotel in
the village, with a careless announcement
to the clerk that the loneliness of the ranch
had outworn his patience, and that his
luggage would be along presently. Then,
after he had been fortified with a solitary
drink at the bar, he betook himself to his cell-like
room, which was the best the hotel afforded,
and there gave himself over to evil
plotting. As a result, when night had fallen
he sent a message by the hotel porter to Fingie
Whalen, who at this hour would doubtless
be found somewhere about Murphy's. Under
the circumstances, naturally enough, he
deemed it a measure of prudence not to visit
Murphy's, where he would be at the mercy
of the men from whom Jim had saved him.
He was sure, however, that Fingie would not
permit any false delicacy to stand in the way
of possible gain. He had decided that he
could make use of the gambler, and of the
gambler's painted woman, Jess, and he meant
to bribe the pair to his purpose.<span class="pagenum">[50]</span></p>

<p>Fingie came promptly. Within fifteen
minutes from the dispatching of the porter,
there came a heavy knock at Dan's door, and
in response to a summons to enter, the squat
form and lowering face of the gambler appeared.
He grinned evilly at Dan, and
swaggered forward truculently.</p>

<p>"What in hell are you up to?" he demanded,
as he came to a standstill, facing his host, who
remained sprawling in a chair, seemingly
quite at ease. Dan had determined precisely
on how to conduct himself in the interview.
So, now, he waved his hand hospitably toward
a bottle of whiskey which, with a jug of water
and glasses, stood on the table.</p>

<p>"Help yourself," he exclaimed genially,
"and sit down. I want to have a talk with
you."</p>

<p>"You'll have to do some mighty tall talkin'
to get rid of them extra four kyards I seen
with my own eyes," Fingie retorted. He approached
the table, however, without any reluctance,
where he helped himself liberally
before seating himself.<span class="pagenum">[51]</span></p>

<p>Dan made his explanations glibly.</p>

<p>"I got on to the fact that I was getting the
bad end of a crooked deal in that card game....
Now, hold your horses!" he commanded,
as Fingie scowled and would have spoken.
"I don't mean anything for you to get mad
about. Only, the four of you were doing me
up. I had too much of Murphy's dope, and
tried a silly trick. It failed, as it ought to
have failed, and I was in bad. I'm sorry, and
I want you to let bygones be bygones. You
bruised me up good and plenty, if that's any
satisfaction to you, and, besides, you got my
money. Not quite all of it, however!" he
added suggestively. He noted with satisfaction
the increasing amiability of Fingie's expression,
and the avaricious glint in the ferret
eyes of the man at the concluding words.</p>

<p>"What's the game?" Fingie demanded
bluntly.</p>

<p>Dan forthwith revealed in detail the work
he required to be done. He felt himself safe
in being candid with this accomplice, who was
wholly free from any moral restraints, and<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
who, as he now made known with many oaths,
was still suffering from a swollen jaw, the
result of one of Jim's blows. In fine, the
gambler entered into the conspiracy with such
evident zest that Dan was able to make a better
bargain than he had expected for his services
and those of his mistress. For an hour,
the two discussed the vicious plot, and then,
at Dan's bidding, Fingie went in quest of the
woman, Jess. Presently, he returned with
her, and she, too, was stirred to pleasurable
anticipations of the evils to be wrought
through her aid. For, on one occasion, she
had cast languishing and provocative glances
on Jim Maxwell, which he had returned with
a look in which pity could not conceal repugnance.</p>

<p>There was a round of drinks for the three,
and then Dan made his payment to the gambler.
This done, Jess was seated at the table
with writing materials, and took from Dan's
dictation a note, which she wrote in her natural
hand, without any effort toward disguise,
and signed with her own name. When, at<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
last, the worthy pair took their leave, that note
remained in the possession of their host.</p>

<p>Dangerous Dan's activities for the day were
not yet completed. Within an hour, he was
astride a horse from the hotel livery, riding
rapidly toward the Maxwell ranch. When
he was within a quarter of a mile from the
house, he dismounted, and hid his horse behind
some bushes by the roadside. He went
forward on foot cautiously, for it was moonlight,
and objects were clearly discernible.
Yet, he had little apprehension of being observed,
for he knew the customs of the place:
that, though it still lacked an hour to midnight,
the household would doubtless be fast
asleep. There were dogs, it was true, which
ran at large; but with these Dan had made
friends, and they would raise no outcry against
him, though he came with malignant purpose.</p>

<p>Dan, after he reached the lawns that spread
before the house, picked his way so as to keep
within the shadows of the trees and shrubberies.
He avoided the gravel of the drive<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
and the walks, going noiselessly over the turf.
The dogs charged upon him, welcoming, but
gave no alarm. Burglary was a thing almost
unknown in this region, and the ranch-house,
as Dan knew, was left quite unprotected from
thievery&mdash;or worse. The prowler, when he
had come to the porch, took off his shoes, and
then crept silently up the steps, and on to a
window of the living-room. As he had anticipated,
it was open, though there was a wire
screen. Under Dan's hand, the screen was
raised. It slid easily along its grooves, and
in another moment Dan stepped into the room.
Enough moonlight fell through the side windows
for him to see his way distinctly. He
crossed to a corner in which was a writing-desk,
commonly used by the master of the
house for the keeping of papers not sufficiently
important for the safe. Conspicuous upon it
was lying a letter-case of Russia leather.
Dan could distinguish the darker shadow of
its outline upon the surface of oak. With a
deft certainty of movement, he took from his
pocket the note he had that night dictated to<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
the gambler's woman, and, opening the case,
thrust it within one of the compartments.
Immediately, he retraced his steps across the
room, and climbed out through the window,
where he paused to lower the screen. When
he had descended the porch steps, he sat down
on the grass, and put on his shoes again. In
due time, he reached his horse, and rode back
to the town, filled with unholy joy over the
success of his expedition.</p>

<p>Dan, like many another conscienceless
scoundrel, slept soundly after his evil work.
Yet, he was early astir, for time pressed, and
there was still much to be done toward the
accomplishment of his design. He found the
morning clear, to his vast relief, since, had
rain come, Jim would in all likelihood have
remained at the ranch-house, thus shutting off
the possibility of Dan's seeing Lou alone,
which was his immediate purpose. At once,
then, after he had breakfasted, he mounted
and rode to the ranch-house boldly. He had
no lack of courage, and freely ran the risk of
meeting the man whose hospitality he had so<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
abused. That risk, he knew, must be encountered
for the sake of his plan. But he
knew, also, that the chances of an encounter
were small with the harvest requiring the
rancher's presence in the fields.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, when he rode up to the
house, he neither saw nor heard anything of
its master. But, even before he dropped from
the saddle, he saw Lou, sitting on the porch
with idly folded hands, and with an expression
of deep melancholy casting its shadows
over the delicate loveliness of her face. Dan's
heart leaped exultantly. He wondered if, by
any chance, the reflex of her mood from yesterday
might contain some measure of sadness
on his account. The slightest feeling of
womanly compassion for the culprit might
prove invaluable to him in his campaign of
treachery. He was annoyed for a moment
over the presence of Nell on the porch, playing
with a doll. But a second thought caused
him to decide that the child's company at the
outset of the interview might be of benefit to
him, as likely to place restraint on the mother's<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
expression of anger against him.... That he
was right in his conjecture, the issue proved.</p>

<p>At sight of Dan McGrew, riding to the
door from which he had been so ignominiously
spurned less than twenty-four hours before,
Lou Maxwell sat in dazed amazement, which
swiftly merged in anger, untinged by any
thought of fear. That the man was dangerous,
she knew. But she was no longer to
be entrapped by a belief in the self-restraint
of this lover. Moreover, she was on her
guard now, not unsuspecting, as yesterday.
And, too, there were servants within call.
These things flashed upon her in the instant of
perceiving him. So, she knew that she need
not fear anything from him beyond the insult
of his presence. But that he should dare thus
to approach startled and confounded her by
the sheer audacity of the act. She was stupefied
by the effrontery of the man as he dismounted
and ascended the steps toward her.
She rose, under a sudden impulse of resentment,
and stood regarding him with a level
gaze, wherein was contempt that might have<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
caused a weaker man to quail. But Dangerous
Dan had the courage of his wickedness,
and he was not to be intimidated, or swerved
from his design, by her contumely, even
though to win her favor was the dearest purpose
of his heart. For the present, he must
withstand stolidly the shafts of her disdain, to
the end that he might entice her to his will
against her own.</p>

<p>Dan swept the cap from his head, and stood
undaunted, yet with an air of humility that
was disarming. There was something pitiful
in the appealing glance of his eyes, something
almost pathetic in the soft tone of humiliation
with which he spoke.</p>

<p>"I want you to forgive me, Lou&mdash;if you can
forgive me&mdash;for a madness I couldn't help....
I'm sorry."</p>

<p>Somehow, the woman was appeased, despite
herself. Her wrath against the man
who had affronted her so mortally was no
whit lessened; yet, his manner of humble contrition
touched her, against her will, to a feeling
of compassion. She still loathed him;<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
notwithstanding, her mood was unmistakably
tinctured by commiseration. She hesitated
for a moment, then turned toward Nell, who,
with round eyes of wonder, was regarding her
mother and their late visitor.</p>

<p>"Run out in the rose-garden, dear," she said
quietly, "and play there for a little while."</p>

<p>The child went obediently enough, though
with obvious reluctance, for her curiosity was
aroused. She had passed from sight around
the corner of the house before Lou spoke
again. Then, she did not mince her words:</p>

<p>"You have no right either to ask or to expect
forgiveness," she said sternly. Her voice
was very cold, charged with bitter contempt.
"You have shown the kind of a man you really
are. Nothing can change that. I despise
you utterly. I hope I shall never set eyes on
you again. I do not wish to hear another
word from you. Your presence is hateful to
me. Go! My husband may come at any moment,
and, if he finds you here, he'll kill you
on sight, as you deserve."</p>

<p>With the last words, she turned from him,<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
unheeding his exclamation of remonstrance,
and went into the living-room.</p>

<p>Dan did not hesitate to follow her.</p>

<p>"Let me say this much, at least," he pleaded,
still with utmost humility. "I sinned so because
I loved you so. I could not hold myself
back. Forgive me, Lou." His voice was tenderly
entreating.</p>

<p>The woman faced him resolutely. Her
eyes were sparkling with wrath, her voice
shook a little under the throb of emotion.</p>

<p>"You, and your love!" she cried, in disgust.
"Faugh! Must I summon the servants to put
you out of the house?"</p>

<p>Dan made an appealing gesture. He answered
with a tone of deprecation.</p>

<p>"No, Lou, you need not do that. I'll go
in a moment, and never trouble you again.
But, before I go, I must tell you one thing&mdash;why
I lost my self-control yesterday. It was
because I saw you so tender and fond and devoted
and unsuspecting in your love for a
man who is&mdash;unworthy!"</p>

<p>Lou started involuntarily, then stood rigid,<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
too astounded for speech. But, in another
moment, she cried out in vehement rebuke:</p>

<p>"How dare you speak like that of Jim!"
Her tone was virulent; the dark-brown eyes,
usually so limpidly soft in their light, flashed
with the fires of her anger. "Jim is as clean
as you are foul. How dare you insinuate
anything against him! Almost, I wish I
hadn't interfered to save your life yesterday.
Oh, you beast! How dare you!"</p>

<p>"Because it's true," Dan retorted. He felt
now that the situation was well within his
grasp, and there was an authoritative ring in
his voice that somehow, against her will,
caused a chill of apprehension in his listener.
He went on speaking swiftly, with incisive
earnestness, as one not to be denied. "You
see, Lou, I know the truth, and you do not.
For example, where is Jim this morning?"</p>

<p>He shot the question at her with such
unexpectedness that she answered involuntarily:</p>

<p>"Why, Jim's out in the fields, of course."
She realized suddenly the insolence of the<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
question, and would have added a scathing rebuke.</p>

<p>But Dan went on imperturbably:</p>

<p>"Of course, you say that, because you do
not know. But he was wise enough to tell
you that he must go to town to-day, to attend
the meeting of the directors of the bank."</p>

<p>Lou smiled in derision.</p>

<p>"To-day is the regular weekly meeting," she
said, with an inflection of dawning curiosity,
which Dan noted complacently. "He always
goes to the bank-meeting. Why shouldn't he?"</p>

<p>"No reason at all," was the suave response.
"But there is every reason in decency why he
should not go to another place, of which you
know nothing." He spoke in a voice that was
significant, grave, portentous. "That's where
he is now."</p>

<p>"You mean something&mdash;something nasty, I
suppose," the wife exclaimed. Her tone was
full of abhorrence for this traducer of the
man she loved and trusted. "I'll listen to
none of your lies against Jim, Dan McGrew."<span class="pagenum">[63]</span></p>

<p>"I chanced on some information in the town
last night," Dan persisted, undismayed by her
outbreak. "I have heard gossip before.
There's a woman&mdash;one of the sort you good
women shrink from. She had been drinking
too much. She let drop something about the
rich man who was coming to visit her to-day,
and she said his name was Jim."</p>

<p>Lou felt a tremor of fear. The jealousy
that sleeps or wakes in the heart of all lovers
stirred within her for the first time. She
sought to stifle it, ashamed of even a thought
of doubt as to her husband's loyalty. It was
monstrous that she should be thus moved by
slanderous accusations of one for whom she
had only contempt. Again, she would have
spoken, but the man forestalled her.</p>

<p>"The woman, whose name is Jess, was
bragging in her cups that her lover, Jim, always
came when she sent for him. And she
said she had written him&mdash;Jim&mdash;to visit her
to-day."</p>

<p>The speaker's sneering assurance, his malignant
emphasis on her husband's name, filled<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
the measure of the wife's wrath full to overflowing.
She advanced a step, raised her
right arm, and with all her strength struck the
palm of her hand across Dan's cheek.</p>

<p>"Liar!" she cried, savagely.</p>

<p>The man did not flinch under the blow.
The eyes of the two clashed, and held steadily.
Dan's cheek whitened where the stroke had
fallen, then burned redly. It was the woman's
gaze that dropped at last, and Dan smiled,
cynically exultant.</p>

<p>"I don't ask you to believe me," he said impressively.
"I only ask you to open your eyes
to the truth. I suppose Jim would take pains
to destroy any note from the woman, Jess.
But there's always a chance. Men get careless
when they have wives that are so very
trusting." His sharp eyes perceived a lessening
tension in the woman's form, a growing
listlessness in the expression of her face. He
knew that there had come a reaction from the
strain of her emotions, that her will was growing
impotent, that now, at last, she would be
pliant to his purpose.<span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>

<p>He strode to the desk, and drew out the
letter-case, while Lou watched his every movement
narrowly, as though she expected some
trickery, while powerless further to combat
him. Her loyalty to Jim was no less, but her
powers of resistance had snapped. So, she
looked on as Dan fumbled for a moment
among the papers in the letter-case, and then
held out to her the note that the woman had
written in his room at the hotel, the night
before.</p>

<p>Lou took it rather gropingly, in mechanical
obedience, because of the utter weariness that
was fallen upon her. She read it with eyes
that were dimmed&mdash;and again. Then, she
stood staring still at the page of coarse paper
with its rudely scrawled lines, with its words
of vile insinuation; but her gaze was unseeing.
The man's voice came to her very
faintly, as from a great distance.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"It's all a lie, of course," Lou said, feebly.
"But I&mdash;don't understand."</p>

<p>The cynical exultation in Dan's smile grew.<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
At last, he was bold enough to bring the affair
to a crisis.</p>

<p>"Do you dare to ride with me to the town,
to test the thing for yourself?"</p>

<p>"Do I dare?" Lou repeated, arousing in
some degree from her apathy. "What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean just that," he said. His voice was
intentionally brutal. "You've begun already
to be afraid of the truth. Do you dare to
ride to town with me, and so test the truth with
your own eyes?"</p>

<p>The taunt provoked her to a new anger, to a
new strength. Once again, the slender form
grew tense, the head was raised proudly. Her
voice came harshly. There was no note of
fear in it now, only a great disdain and something
of cruelty.</p>

<p>"I will ride with you, Dan McGrew," was
her answer, "to find my husband, and I shall
tell him what you've said, and he'll kill you.
Now, do you dare?"</p>

<p>"I dare," the man said, quietly. "Let's go."<span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>Dan McGrew had plotted with devilish
cleverness. He had seized on the
fact of Jim's attendance at the bank-meeting
as timely to his purpose. He had, indeed,
made it the pivot about which the details of
his scheming were grouped. As a result of
his carefulness in planning, during the hour of
his interview with Lou, Fingie Whalen was
stationed in the street outside Murphy's saloon.
He sat on a bench that stood against the wall
of the structure, and smoked incessant cigarettes,
the while his ferret eyes scanned closely
the length of the main street, down which Jim
Maxwell must ride on his way to the bank.
Just before him, a saddled horse stood patiently,
with the bridle-rein trailing. Within
the saloon, Jess, also, waited&mdash;with a drink, as
well as a cigarette, to comfort her in the interval.
Thus, it befell that, when Jim Maxwell<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
came riding briskly into the town, his approach
was noted from afar by eyes hired for
the purpose. Instantly, then, Fingie acted.
He sprang up, and darted into the back room
of the saloon, where he called Jess's name, and
beckoned. The response of the woman was
no less prompt. She stood up quickly, and
hurried out of the place, while Fingie himself
remained to peer anxiously from the window
that gave on the street. There, for a minute,
he observed events outside. Afterward, he
lounged against the bar with a gratified smirk.</p>

<p>Jim, as he rode slowly down the main street,
idly noted the woman who hastened out of
Murphy's, and mounted astride the horse.
He wondered a little that she did not start
away. But, as he drew closer, his keen eyes
perceived that the form of the woman was
swaying unsteadily in the saddle. Alarmed
for her safety, though with a suspicion that
only excess of drink ailed her, Jim quickened
his horse's pace&mdash;too late. Before he could
reach her, the woman lurched, and fell heavily
to the ground, where she lay motionless, evidently<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
stunned, if not more seriously injured,
while the startled horse backed away snuffing.</p>

<p>Jim was on the ground almost as quickly as
the woman herself, and was beside her before
the few others in the street who came running.
He did the natural thing under the circumstances,
precisely as Dan McGrew had expected
that he would. Since the woman lay
with closed eyes, showing no signs of consciousness,
unless in the faint moaning that issued
from her rouged lips, Jim lifted her in
his arms, and bore her through the side door,
which Fingie had thoughtfully left ajar, into
the back room of Murphy's saloon.... It
was at this moment that the gambler left the
window to lounge unconcernedly against the
bar. Jim carried his burden to one of the
round tables which was empty, and placed her
gently upon it, continuing to support her with
his arms about the waist and shoulders.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 340px;">
 <a href="images/p049f.jpg">
 <img border="0" src="images/p049t.jpg" width="340" height="222" alt="p049t" title="" />
 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">JIM CARRIED HIS BURDEN TO ONE OF THE ROUND TABLES.</p>

<p>"Bring brandy!" he called out sharply to
the nearest of the occupants of the room, who
now came crowding forward with ejaculations
of dismay. The man addressed was Fingie<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
Whalen himself. He stared down at the
woman with shocked surprise writ large on
his sullen features.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Jess!" he mumbled, in a voice
that he vainly strove to fill with distress.
"Whatever has she been an' gone, an' done?"</p>

<p>"Get that brandy!" Jim reiterated the
command curtly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Fingie answered humbly, and
hurried off to the bar. In a moment, he was
back with the liquor, which he held to the
woman's lips. To Jim's relief, Jess swallowed
the draft easily enough&mdash;to tell the
truth, rather greedily; but of that fact her
rescuer was quite unaware, and from it he
augured well.</p>

<p>Jess managed her apparent recovery from
the effects of the fall with such art as she
possessed, which, in truth, was not of the
highest, though ample for the beguiling of a
man who was honest and kindly and wholly
unsuspecting. Soon, her eyes unclosed a little,
and she breathed more deeply, and the
moaning, which had been interrupted by the<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
brandy, was resumed more vigorously.
Through the paint on her cheeks showed the
deeper red of a genuine flush, the natural result
of the dram, but a sure evidence of vitality,
none the less. Jim rejoiced over these
signs of restoration, and even smiled on Fingie,
as he bade him continue the chafing of
the woman's hands.</p>

<p>"She's not seriously hurt," he remarked,
with much satisfaction in his voice; "though
the way she flopped off that horse was enough
to jar her teeth loose." Being ignorant of the
fact that Jess had been a member of a circus
troupe before she yielded to the blandishments
of the gambler, Jim wondered mightily that so
severe a fall should have had no worse effect.</p>

<p>Jess opened her eyes wide, and stared up
blankly into the face of the man who held her
in his arms.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" she asked, with the languid
air of her favorite stage heroine when
swooning.</p>

<p>"It's all right," Jim hastened to explain
soothingly, having due regard to her dazed<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
condition. "You were dizzy for a second, I
suspect, and fell from your horse. But there
doesn't seem to be anything much the matter,
and you'll be all right in a jiffy." He addressed
Fingie.</p>

<p>"Bring her another nip of the brandy."</p>

<p>The gambler would have remonstrated
against this unnecessary extravagance, but
could find no plausible reason for refusal, and
Jess, who was enjoying herself hugely, offered
him no assistance. When the drink had been
brought, she swallowed it without too much
display of eagerness, and coughed as a lady
should who is unaccustomed to strong waters.
At once thereafter, she straightened up to a
sitting posture on the table, though she still
accepted the support of Jim's arms to his discomfiture,
and regarded him with coquettish
glances of gratitude, which were offensive to
him, and to Fingie Whalen as well. He tried
to withdraw his arms, but she leaned upon him
too heavily, and he was forced for a few minutes
longer to retain her in a passive embrace.
But, as he repeated the effort tentatively, Jess<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
bethought herself that her recovery had now
advanced so far as to make such support unnecessary.
Therefore, to play her part, she
withdrew herself, and sat up unassisted, but
with a hand to her brow to indicate that her
brain had not yet wholly cleared.</p>

<p>"Oh, you have been so good to me, Mister!"
she gushed. "I shall be thankful to you to
my dying day. Why," she added in a burst
of imagination, "the horse might have stepped
on me, if you hadn't been right there to save
me."</p>

<p>"Nothing like that, I'm sure," Jim declared,
as amiably as he could contrive. "The horse
seemed to be doing his best not to step on you
without any help from me. You don't owe
me any thanks, really."</p>

<p>Jess put out an appealing hand. It was accepted
reluctantly by Jim, and, with his assistance,
and that of Fingie on the other side,
she got down from the table totteringly, and
sank into a chair, where she sat limply, with
closed eyes, following her r&ocirc;le devotedly to
the end.<span class="pagenum">[74]</span></p>

<p>"You'll have a drink with us, Mr. Maxwell,"
Fingie urged, twisting his lowering features
to an expression of affability. "What's
past is past an' done. You sure did give me
an almighty swat on the jaw t'other day, but
I ain't one to nuss no grouch, an' Jess here, an'
me, we're plumb grateful for yer kindness to
her this mornin'. What'll you have, Mr.
Maxwell? I'll bring it."</p>

<p>Jim shook his head in refusal. He, too,
had no wish to nourish a grudge; but he had
no liking for the gambler&mdash;less for the woman,
whose tawdry airs nauseated him. He was
already a little disgusted, with the episode,
and desirous to end it.</p>

<p>Jess saw the refusal in his face, and was
quick to intervene; for failure now would
mean the utter collapse of all their plotting.
She spoke gently, and, in the genuineness of
her anxiety, her voice trembled with appeal:</p>

<p>"Please, sir&mdash;please, Mr. Maxwell!" she besought
him.</p>

<p>Jim, in spite of his repulsion, was touched
by the woman's earnestness. His sense of<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
chivalry impelled him to yield to a plea so
natural and so ingenuous on her part. He
smiled, a bit wryly, in answer to her imploring
look, and nodded assent.</p>

<p>"I'll have a glass of beer," he said to Fingie,
and, as the gambler hurried off to the bar,
he seated himself at the table beside Jess.</p>

<p>The woman prattled nervously, made garrulous
by the brandy, and by fatuous ambition
to impress this aloof companion with her
charms. As a matter of fact, the conspiracy
came perilously near to failure in consequence
of her chatting, which almost drove Jim to
flight. His instinct of politeness, however,
conquered inclination, and he remained in his
place, listening with a forced semblance of
interest to hide how desperately he was bored.
Yet, throughout, he rested without a faintest
suspicion that this affair was aught beyond the
innocent thing it seemed. To him, the happening
was merely a nuisance&mdash;nothing more,
nothing in any wise sinister. It did not occur
to him to wonder why Fingie should have
volunteered to serve as their waiter. He did<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
not trouble even to follow the gambler with
his eyes, as the fellow went to the bar.</p>

<p>For that matter, it would have availed Jim
nothing, had he watched never so closely.
The card-sharp possessed the dexterity of his
trade. Those long, slender, mobile fingers of
his had been fashioned by fate for a surgeon,
a conjurer, a gambler, or a pick-pocket. Not
even the keen-eyed bartender, who was close
to him, noticed the tiny vial in Fingie's hand,
as it hovered over the frothing glass of beer
on the counter, or saw the trickle of the colorless
drops into the brew. So, the gambler
came back to the table presently, with a tray,
on which were two glasses of brandy&mdash;one for
himself, of generous size; the other for Jess,
so tiny that she frowned indignantly at sight
of it&mdash;and the glass of beer for Jim. The
three drank together.... Then, the gambler
and his woman watched avidly for what
should befall.</p>

<p>There was no delay. Jim, glad that the
ordeal was at last done, would have risen to
leave. But a strange lethargy held him fastbound.<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
A black cloud descended on his
brain; thought ceased. Suddenly, he slumped
in his chair. His arms dropped heavily on
the table. His head fell on them. Fingie
and Jess chuckled aloud in gloating over the
inert form of the man. They were not afraid
lest he hear them, now.<span class="pagenum">[78]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>There was not a word exchanged between
Lou and Dan on their ride from
the ranch-house to the town. For his part,
the man was filled with rejoicing over the triumph
that he anticipated. He had no fear
of failure. The ingenuity of his plot insured
success. Its strength lay in the seeming simplicity
of the events that would lead to the
desired climax. Dan's only doubt had been
concerning his ability to hold the woman to
his will, and to make her play her vital part
in his machinations. He had realized that
he would have need of all his wit to secure
from her even a hearing of his accusations
against the man she loved. By his arts, he
had enticed her into listening, and by reason
of the very indignation thus aroused, he had
warped her mood to his purpose. So, he
went forward full of confidence as to the outcome,<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
exultant, heedless of the misery of the
woman who rode by his side.</p>

<p>That misery was poignant. At intervals,
wrath flamed high in her, and she longed for
the moment when she should bring the two
men face to face, that the slanderer might receive
the punishment he merited from the one
maligned. But, oftener, her emotion dropped
into abysses of despair. There had been
something unspeakably revolting to her
wifely instincts in the tawdry phrases of the
ill-written note, signed "Your loving Jess."
Her spirit writhed as she recalled the words,
so damning in their explicitness: "Shall expect
you at the usual time. Don't let your
trusting Lou keep you away, as I can't do
without you." The wife found herself compelled
to fight with all her energies against
the demon of doubt that so hideously beset
her. That note had been addressed to "Dearest
Jim." And Jim was her husband's name,
and the note had been lying in his letter-case.
And, if these things of themselves were not
enough to sap faith, there was the sneering<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
use of her own name: "Don't let your trusting
Lou keep you away." The distracted
wife told herself a hundred times that her belief
in the loyalty of her husband remained unshaken,
but it was not so. She lied to herself,
from very horror of the truth. Only by fierce
and incessant denials of the doubt that welled
in her could she repel the assaults of despair.
Of the man beside her, she thought hardly at
all, except in the fitful and constantly lessening
flashes of her anger. Her thought was for
the husband, with a pitiful wondering over
the hateful mystery that had come to pass.
Oh, surely, there was some simple explanation
of it all&mdash;there must be! It was a hoax, a
jest, some misunderstanding&mdash;anything! But,
though she argued against belief, there remained
always in her consciousness the stubborn,
sickening facts, and a great dread lay
crushingly upon her spirit. The agony of
suspense grew unbearable. Her quirt rose
and fell in a vicious lash on the flanks of the
mare. The astonished thoroughbred leaped
and stretched into a run.... Dan McGrew<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
pressed his own mount forward, to keep pace.</p>

<p>While the two thus rode toward the town,
there was a period of tedious inaction for
Dan's accomplices. In the back room of
Murphy's saloon, Jess remained impatiently
in her seat at the table, with the empty brandy
glass before her. She would have liked another
drink, but dared not call for it, since it
had been forbidden by her master, because her
part in the sordid drama was not yet finished.
Beside her, Jim sat motionless, his body
sprawled clumsily over the table. He had
not stirred since his yielding to the influence
of the drug. The only evidence of life about
him was the sound of stertorous breathing.
The habitu&eacute;s of the place had given no heed
to him after a few sneering comments concerning
one who would get drunk so early in
the day.</p>

<p>Fingie Whalen, after he had seen his drops
take effect on the victim, went out of the saloon,
and re&euml;stablished himself on the bench
against the wall, where once again he gave
himself over to an unremitting survey of the<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
main street, down which any one coming from
the ranch must pass. He smoked with nervous
rapidity, which increased as minute after
minute passed, and there was still no sight of
those for whom he watched. At the end of an
hour, the gambler's impatience had become
anxiety. He began to fear failure at the last,
when success had seemed assured. It might
well be that, in spite of Jess's note, Dan
McGrew had been unable to persuade Lou
Maxwell into accompanying him. Or&mdash;as
would be equally disastrous&mdash;they might come
too late. Fingie had been as liberal as he
dared in the drugging of the beer, but there
is a great difference in the reactive powers of
various men against such poison. He had not
been minded to run any risk of murder.
Therefore, he could not tell with precision
when Jim Maxwell would recover consciousness.
As the minutes hurried on, Fingie's fear
mounted by leaps and bounds. From time to
time, he left the bench, and peered in through
the window, to reassure himself as to the continued
unconsciousness of the drugged man.<span class="pagenum">[83]</span></p>

<p>Then, at last, as he turned from one of these
glimpses through the window, Fingie Whalen
saw in the distance the forms of two riders
coming at a furious gallop. For a second, he
stood staring, to make sure that there was no
mistake, that these were in fact those for whom
he had waited with such anxiety. In another
moment, he became certain that one of the
two who approached was Dan McGrew.
The flapping of a divided skirt proved that the
other rider was a woman. He could no
longer doubt that McGrew had succeeded.
There needed now only to set the stage for the
final scene. For the second time that day,
Fingie whirled and darted into the saloon.
He caught up from the bar a glass of brandy,
which he had left under the barkeeper's
charge, since he had not deemed it safe on the
table within Jess's reach. He moved now
without undue haste, in order to avoid attracting
attention to himself and the others concerned.
When he had reached the table at
which Jess and their victim were seated, he
put the glass down, with a nod to the woman<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
to indicate that the end of the play was now at
hand. Jess shoved her chair close to that in
which Jim slouched. At the same time, Fingie
seized the unconscious man by the shoulders,
and lifted the heavy form upright in the
chair. Jim yielded limply to the procedure&mdash;a
dead weight in the other's grasp. He was
still unconscious. His face was hot and
flushed, the face of one under the influence of
liquor. His breath still came noisily. Fingie,
straining under the weight, tilted the flaccid
body over a little way, until it rested
against the shoulder of Jess, who braced herself
to sustain it. Fingie raised Jim's left
arm, as the unconscious man reposed thus
against the woman at his right, and laid it
about her neck. Thus the two remained in
an embrace, which bore every evidence of
fondness that knew no shame in this public
and disreputable place. Jim's head sagged,
until it rested upon the woman's bosom. Her
right arm was wreathed about him, holding
him tenaciously, with all her strength, lest he
lurch away from her. With her left hand,<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
she took up the glass of brandy, which Fingie
had brought, and held it close to the lips of
the unconscious man.</p>

 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">JIM'S HEAD SAGGED UNTIL IT RESTED UPON THE WOMAN'S BOSOM.</p>

<p>Such was the business of the piece, as it had
been arranged beforehand in each detail by
the conspirators. Jess cast a look of inquiry
toward the gambler, to learn whether or not
the situation met all the requirements of the
plot. He gave a brief nod, and grunted approval.
He heard the clatter of hoofs in the
street outside&mdash;a clatter of hoofs of horses
ridden in haste. It ceased just without the
door of the saloon. Fingie walked quietly
to the bar. A quick glance about showed that
the attention of none had been attracted to his
movements. He grinned evilly in anticipation....
From the time when he had first
sighted the riders, not more than a half-minute
had elapsed. He leaned against the bar,
and stared furtively toward the window that
gave on the street.</p>

<p>Dan McGrew drew close alongside Lou, as
the pair pounded down the main street of the
town.<span class="pagenum">[86]</span></p>

<p>"Stop at the corner, this side of the bank,"
he called to her. "At Murphy's saloon."</p>

<p>The woman shivered as her ears caught the
words. She knew the character of the notorious
place, which catered to the most depraved
tastes of the community. Was it to a
resort so ignoble that she must go to refute the
slander against her husband? To refute it!
Or&mdash;she broke off her thought, appalled by
the terrible alternative. Then, in the following
instant, she found herself already abreast
of the saloon. She heard her companion's
brisk command:</p>

<p>"Stop here!"</p>

<p>She obeyed, though, almost, the dread that
beat upon her forced her to flee on, and on&mdash;anywhere
away from the horror that menaced.
She pulled her mare to a standstill, and got
down from the saddle, and let the bridle-reins
trail. She moved as one in a dream&mdash;rather,
as one in a nightmare. Yet, now the crisis
was upon her, she did not suffer quite so
cruelly. Her feeling was numbed, somehow.
It was with a certain listlessness in her voice<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
that she addressed Dan McGrew, as he
stepped to her side.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"There's no need to go inside," Dan explained.
"We can see enough, I fancy,
through the window.... Come!"</p>

<p>Lou followed obediently whither he led.
So the two came to the window, with the dirty
glass and its tattered shade raised high, so that
whosoever would might look freely on the
squalor within. Dan stepped forward and
peered into the room for a moment, then
turned and beckoned to Lou.... And the
wife advanced, as he bade her, and looked
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Lou's eyes, accustomed to the full glare of
the noon-day sun, could at first distinguish
nothing more than a vague litter of weaving
shadows within the murk of the dingy room.
Very soon, however, her vision adjusted itself
to the dim interior, so that she began to see
distinctly. Even in this moment of emotional
stress, Lou was conscious of her repugnance
at the spectacle of coarsely flaunted vice. She<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
noted the line of sodden men loafing along the
bar, the few others grouped about the tables
with the bedizened and painted women,
whose wanton faces, and more wanton manners,
proclaimed their unsavory sort. Yet,
her attention was thus arrested for only a
fleeting fraction of a second. Then her gaze
fell on that other table and she saw her husband.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt as to Jim's identity.
As she recognized him, Lou's dark
brown eyes dilated before the fearfulness of
this thing. For she saw, as well, every detail
of his visible plight. The scene was etched
on her consciousness with the acid of horror,
there to remain indelible throughout the
years. She knew, in the first second of seeing,
every feature of the creature within whose
arms her husband was lying. She knew the
cut and color of the soiled bodice, with its
drapery of cheap lace over the bosom&mdash;on
which his loved face reposed. She felt a
nausea. There was nothing lovable now in
his face. Instead, it was bestial, repulsive&mdash;the<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
face of a man who had given himself over
to gratification of the beast within him, and
who was wallowing in the mire of his degradation....
So it seemed to Lou Maxwell,
as she stood staring, bereft, upon that scene
which to her meant the end of all things.
The life had gone out of her face. A sickness
as of death clutched at her heart. Suddenly
her gauntleted hands caught Dan McGrew's
shoulder. Only his quick support
saved her from falling. She spoke dully, in
a broken whisper:</p>

<p>"Take me away."<span class="pagenum">[90]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>Lou was able to climb to her saddle with
Dan's assistance, though she moved very
feebly, and her white, drawn face was that of
one who had been stricken with a mortal hurt.
But once safely mounted, with less strain on
her muscles, a little strength flowed back into
her, so that she sat steadily enough as the two
started back at a walk over the way down
which they had ridden so furiously. By the
time the town was left well behind, the
fresh air and the motion had restored her faculties
in part, both physical and mental. But
with the clearing of her brain came an agony
of realization almost unendurable. She
urged her horse to its full speed, fain to put
all distance possible between her and the detestable
scene on which she had just looked.
Indeed, the instinct of flight in this crisis of
her fate was dominant. Her one desire was<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
to flee to the ends of the earth, to escape forever
from all that had been.</p>

<p>Throughout the years of her life hitherto,
Lou had experienced no real anguish. Her
sorrows, great though some of them had
seemed to her as child and woman, had been
essentially trivial, over trivial things. She
had never known the ills of poverty. The
death of her father had occurred while yet
she, the only child, was too young to grieve
deeply or long. Her mother's death had occurred
some years after her marriage, when
she had been weaned from the old home-life.
In truth, all her years had been pleasant ones.
The sum of her happiness had been far beyond
that of most. The love between her and
her husband had been a beautiful one, in
which she had found supreme content. It
had been crowned by the birth of the child.
It had held the promise of serenely joyous
years to come.... And now, the catastrophe!
Here was the end of all things. Doubt
of her husband's loyalty had never tainted her
devotion. She had believed utterly in his<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
cleanness, his wholesome manhood. And
now, in an instant, the whole fabric of her life
was in shreds, beyond any possibility of reweaving;
befouled beyond any possibility of
purifying. All her happiness had been an
illusion, the gracious charm of it only a mask
that covered the ugly truth.</p>

<p>Lou had never a doubt concerning that
truth. With her own eyes, she had witnessed
it. She had seen Jim in drunken debauch
with the painted woman, who had boasted
that this lover came always at her call. The
wife had seen her husband fondled openly by
a wanton in a public place, had seen the creature
holding the glass to that husband's lips.
Dan McGrew had plotted well. By his intrigue,
he had destroyed absolutely all her
faith and happiness.</p>

<p>The humiliation of the revelation sharpened
the torture. It would not have been
quite so terrible, Lou thought, if Jim had
loved some woman of a decent sort. But the
loathesomeness of being scorned for that infamous
woman of the dance-hall&mdash;! The<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
wife writhed under the ignominy: that a being
so sordid should have ousted her from her
husband's heart. His infatuation for one so
base proved his entire worthlessness. He was
but the gross, soiled caricature of her ideal.
The idol of gold which she had worshiped
was shown to be of clay&mdash;clay filthy and corrupt.</p>

<p>Dan McGrew realized, to some extent at
least, the anguish of the woman at whose side
he rode. Had it been consistent with his purposes,
he would have spared her that suffering.
In his way, he sympathized with her
keenly. Yet the fact that her grief was
wholly of his making, had no cause whatsoever
except the visible lie which he had built
for her eyes to see&mdash;the fact that he alone had
thrust the iron into her soul troubled Dangerous
Dan not at all. He had no remorse,
though he pitied her. He was absolutely
without compunction for the misery he had
wrought. Dangerous Dan was a strong man,
save for his vices. He was a hard man as
well. What he desired, he meant to take, and<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
he was ruthless and unscrupulous as to the
manner of his taking. More than anything
else in the world, he desired to possess for his
own Lou Maxwell. To that end, he had concocted
his scheme of villainy. The woman's
present agony was a necessary part in the success
of his plotting. So, though he was sorry
for her whom he had thus fearfully wronged,
he felt no vestige of regret&mdash;only exultation.
In his way, Dan McGrew loved Lou. His
love for her was, indeed, the chief passion of
his life. But his love, like that of many another
man, was wholly selfish. She was
necessary to his happiness. That he must destroy
her happiness in order to secure his was
of no importance. Moreover, with the egotism
of a strong man, he was confident that he
would be able in the days to come to make her
happier than she had ever been before.</p>

<p>Now, on the ride, Dan discreetly kept
silence. He could follow well enough the
workings of the woman's mood, and he believed
that it would be unwise at this time to
attempt the direction of her thoughts. It<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
seemed to him certain that under the circumstances
she must inevitably reach the conclusion
he desired. There might be danger that
a suggestion from him would provoke suspicion,
though this possibility was remote, after
the effectiveness of the scene on which she had
looked. Nevertheless, despite his confidence
in a victorious issue of the affair, Dan was
glad when Lou went forward at full speed.
He, like Fingie Whalen, knew that the influence
of the drug on Jim Maxwell would be
only of a temporary sort, and that soon the
ranch-owner would recover consciousness.
Just how long an interval there might be before
the husband's return to the ranch, Dan
could not tell. But, because he was in a fever
of impatience for a rapid development of
events, he rejoiced over the haste in which
they rode, and welcomed with a sigh of relief
their arrival at the ranch.</p>

<p>As Lou dismounted, Nell came running
from the porch with a rapturous cry of greeting.
The mother dropped to her knees, and
gathered the girl into her arms, with passionate<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
kisses. She realized, with bitter self-reproach,
that in all this time of trial she had
had not a single thought for the daughter
whom she so loved. In her humiliation as a
wife she had forgotten her obligation as a
mother. Now, abruptly, the shameful significance
to the daughter of what had befallen
was borne in upon Lou's consciousness.</p>

<p>"He is unworthy ever to look on her face
again." She was unaware that in the intensity
of her feeling she had spoken aloud with
deliberate emphasis.</p>

<p>Nell, already somewhat perplexed by the
ardor of these caresses, became even a little
frightened by the unfamiliar expression on
her mother's face, and by the sternly spoken
words, which she did not understand. She
was relieved when, the next moment, she was
released, and she hurried off to her favorite
nook in the rose-garden, where she might
be alone to puzzle over the meaning of it
all.</p>

<p>Unlike the child, Dan McGrew understood<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
exactly the wife's ejaculation, and he knew
that he had achieved his end. Without invitation,
but quite as a matter of course, he
walked at Lou's side as she ascended the steps
and entered the living-room. She accepted
his company without remonstrance, indifferently.
It was only after she had sunk down
into a low easy chair, where she lay back
wearily with closed eyes, while she drew off
her gauntlets, that Dan McGrew finally dared
to address her explicitly:</p>

<p>"You must leave him, of course," he said
gently. His voice was very grave and kindly.
It came with something of a shock to the
woman's ears&mdash;she had forgotten him so completely
in the self-absorption of her mood.
But, too, there was something soothing to her
in the manner of his utterance. She became
aware that here was one to aid her in the accomplishment
of things to be done. She no
longer remembered how, within the hour, she
had execrated this man who now stood before
her. She had become oblivious of the insult<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
he had so recently put upon her. The revelation
of her husband's treachery obsessed her
mind to the exclusion of all else. So, she was
fully disposed to accept the assistance of Dan
McGrew in this emergency. She was ready
to acquiesce in his suggestions for her guidance
in escaping from this place which her
husband had polluted. She sat up in a quick
access of energy.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said harshly, "I must leave him&mdash;at
once." Her animation grew. Her face,
which had been pallid a moment before, was
flushed with eagerness. Her expression became
resolute. "I must take Nell away from
him. I don't want him ever to set eyes on
her again&mdash;he's not fit."</p>

<p>Dan forbore comment. There needed
from him no condemnation of the husband.
The wife's conviction as to Jim's guilt was
complete. So he avoided Lou's reference to
her husband's culpability, and spoke to the
point:</p>

<p>"You want to get away without seeing him<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
again," he remarked, in a tone of positiveness,
as if the matter admitted of no doubt.</p>

<p>"Yes," the wife answered. "It would be
too horrible to see him again! And for
Nell&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dan McGrew nodded sympathetically.</p>

<p>"It would only mean a nasty row," he
agreed. "You might as well spare yourself
that&mdash;and spare the child, too," he concluded,
craftily. For he realized that Lou would fly
fast and far for the child's sake, if not for her
own. He detested the necessity of the child's
presence in their flight, but he recognized the
fact that it was a necessity, and therefore to be
endured&mdash;even, as far as possible, to be turned
to advantage.</p>

<p>"Yes," Lou continued, "we must hurry as
fast as we can, for I suppose there's no telling
when Jim might return. And it would be
dreadful to run into him in the town, on the
way to the train."</p>

<p>Dan McGrew nodded assent.</p>

<p>"It would, indeed!" he declared. "In the<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
condition he's in now there's no telling what
he might do."</p>

<p>Lou shuddered at the memory of her husband's
sodden face, as she had seen it resting on
the breast of the woman in Murphy's saloon.</p>

<p>"We must not meet him!" she declared desperately.
"It would be too terrible to have
him see Nell." She pressed her hands to her
bosom as if to hold back the emotion that
surged within her. "More dreadful for Nell
to see him. I want her to have a clean memory
of her father, whatever he is."</p>

<p>"We can avoid any danger of meeting him,"
Dan McGrew asserted, with a brisk tone of
confidence that reassured his listener. "We'll
just ride across country to the main line. Do
you know the road? I have only a general
idea."</p>

<p>Lou was all eagerness over the suggestion.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she exclaimed excitedly; "that
is the way to do it. I know the road. We
must get ready and start at once. But you
don't need to go with us."</p>

<p>Dan McGrew spoke decisively:<span class="pagenum">[101]</span></p>

<p>"I've got you into this mess, Lou, and it's
up to me to see the thing through. I want to
help you in any way I can&mdash;and just now you
need help." His tone was firm, yet tender,
with a note of devotion in it that touched the
distraught woman. She sprang to her feet
and held out both her hands, which were
seized in a warm clasp.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Dan," she said gently. "God
knows I need help."</p>

<p>Then, forthwith, she became all animation.
She summoned her maid, and ordered that
two small bags which could be carried on
horseback should be packed with necessaries
for herself and Nell. At Dan's suggestion,
she sent an order to the stables for Nell's pony
and two fresh mounts to serve for Dan and
herself. These things done, it occurred to her
that she must leave some explanation of her
departure for her husband on his return.
She seated herself at his desk, and wrote hurriedly
and briefly, in distaste for even this
indirect contact with the man who had
wronged her.<span class="pagenum">[102]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="salutation">Dear Jim:</p>

<p>I know all. I do not want to be in your
path, so am going away. You love another,
so will perhaps not miss me.</p>

<p>Good-by, Jim.</p>

<p>I forgive you.</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">Lou.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lou, when she had set her name to the short
form of words, thrust the sheet into an envelope,
which she addressed with the single
word, "Jim." For long seconds she sat staring
at the lines she had last traced&mdash;that name
which had been through so many years the
symbol of her happiness, which was now become
the symbol of vileness and misery. The
horror of it smote her anew, essenced in that
name which had been her blessing, which was
now become her curse.</p>

<p>The sound of the hoofs stamping on the
gravel before the door aroused her. The
maid came to announce that the horses were in
readiness, with the bags strapped to the saddles.
With the maid came Nell, who had
needed no preparation, since she was already<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
in her riding clothes. Lou took the girl in
her arms and kissed the exquisite dark face
with a tenderness that was like a benediction....
She had no least hint that this was destined
to be the last time her lips should touch
the soft roundness of the girlish cheek.</p>

<p>"You are to ride with me this afternoon,
Nell," she said. "Don't ask any questions
now. I'll tell you all about it by-and-by.
It's a surprise." She shivered over the words.
A surprise&mdash;yes, a surprise that meant the end
of all things. So, presently, the three went
forth from the living-room, and across the
porch, and down the steps, and got into the
saddles of the waiting horses. Without any
exchange of words among them, they rode
away. None of the three looked back&mdash;Nell,
because she had no guess as to the sinister
meaning of this parting; Dan, because even
his calloused soul felt a twinge of shame over
the ruins that he left behind; Lou, because she
could not.<span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>It was not until late afternoon that Jim
slowly struggled back to consciousness.
He was first aware of a deadly nausea, which
seemed billowing through every atom of his
being. Then he felt the torture that stabbed
through his brain. In an effort of revolt, he
raised his head, though the movement tried
his strength to the utmost. His eyes swept
dimly over the scene, and a dull wonder filled
him. Just at first, he did not recognize the
place. Very quickly, however, the acrid
odors of spilled liquors and the reek of cheap
perfumes from the women quickened memory.
Suddenly his eyes opened wide, and he saw
clearly, with new consciousness of his surroundings&mdash;and
of himself. He realized that
in some mysterious fashion, altogether inexplicable
to him, he had been overcome in the<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
back room of Murphy's saloon. His mind
went to the period immediately preceding the
blank in memory. He remembered his presence
there along with the woman, Jess, and
the gambler, and his taking a drink with them.
Of whatever had followed, he had no knowledge.
Evidently, he had suffered a seizure
of some sort. As his faculties were restored,
it occurred to him that he might have been
drugged by the gambler or the woman, for
the purpose of robbery. But a hasty examination
showed that his watch and money were
untouched. Besides, it seemed to him, on
second thought, preposterous that either of the
two should have dared anything of the kind
against him. No, it was certain that he had
been attacked thus without warning by some
unexpected physical ailment. He was rather
alarmed by the experience, as strong men
usually are when unaccustomed weakness assails
them. He determined to submit himself
to a careful examination at the hands of a
competent physician, on his first visit to the
county-seat.<span class="pagenum">[106]</span></p>

<p>The nausea had subsided in some measure,
and the pain in his head, too, had lessened.
But he felt mouth and throat parched. He
got up, moving with difficulty, and, after a
few moments of unsteadiness while he held to
the back of a chair for support, he was able to
stand firmly enough and to walk forward
to the bar.</p>

<p>"Give me a glass of water," he said to the
bar-keeper.</p>

<p>The fellow obeyed with alacrity, for he
knew Jim Maxwell to be a man of importance
in the community, and he had been puzzled
by the events of the day&mdash;even a little frightened
lest trouble come of them. Jim gulped
the water and demanded more. He drank a
number of glasses before his thirst was even
partially quenched. The effect was speedy.
He felt strength returning to him. His brain
was quite clear again.</p>

<p>The bar-tender, watching narrowly, saw
that the ranch-owner was himself once more.
He ventured to speak ingratiatingly, in the
hope of satisfying his curiosity.<span class="pagenum">[107]</span></p>

<p>"That was quite some snoozle, Mister," he
remarked, with a smirk.</p>

<p>"It was nothing of the sort," Jim snapped.
"I don't know what it was. But it was bad
enough."</p>

<p>"I thought mebbe as how you'd had a drop
too much," the bar-keeper explained, "an'
was jest nacherly sleepin' it off. If we'd
knowed you was sick, we'd have got the Doc
in to give you a look-over."</p>

<p>"That's all right," Jim answered. "I'm not
blaming you any&mdash;unless it was the drink you
gave me that poisoned me."</p>

<p>Presently Jim went out into the street. He
found his horse tied to a ring at the corner of
the saloon building. He unhitched it,
mounted, and rode slowly homeward. He
was still in distress physically, but his condition
was improving from moment to moment,
so that he no longer felt apprehension as to the
outcome. Soon, indeed, he became sufficiently
sure of himself to put his horse to a
trot.... As the shadows of evening drew
down, he rode up to the door of his home.<span class="pagenum">[108]</span></p>

<p>There was a bank of lurid clouds in the
west, massed heavily on the horizon. The air
was motionless, weighted with portents of
coming storm. Jim felt the oppressiveness,
and in a subtle way it rested upon his mood
as something sinister. A weight of melancholy
pressed upon him as he entered the
house. The stillness of the air seemed re&euml;nforced
in the quiet of the living-room into
which he stepped. There was no sound. He
listened for his wife's greeting. It did not
come. He listened for the pattering steps of
Nell, running to welcome him. He did not
hear them. The silence hurt him in some
curious way. He had an overwhelming sense
of the absence of those he loved&mdash;the absence
of wife and child.</p>

<p>He crossed the room to his desk. He
slipped the loop of the quirt from his wrist
and let it fall on the desk. The effect of the
drug was not yet assuaged; he was very thirsty.
He called to the maid passing through the
hall:</p>

<p>"Bring me a glass of water, Mary."<span class="pagenum">[109]</span></p>

<p>The girl came quickly with the drink. She
and the other servants were in a ferment of
curiosity, full of suspicions and wonderings.
There had been much gossip in the house over
the fight between the two men the day before,
which had not passed unobserved. To-day,
the wife had suddenly left her home with the
man who had been ordered out of the house.
Over this fact, scandalous tongues were clacking
loudly. Mary had made it her business
to be passing in the hall, in order that she
might note the attitude of the master at such
a time. So she stood, in eager expectation,
eying her master closely, as he took the glass
of water.</p>

<p>But he set the glass back on the tray suddenly,
for he saw an envelope lying on the
desk, addressed in the handwriting of the
woman he loved:</p>

<p>"Jim."</p>

<p>A foreboding of disaster crashed upon him.
He trembled, standing there with the envelope
unopened in his hand. Then he strove
to throw off this craven dread&mdash;for which<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
there was no reason. He turned to the maid.</p>

<p>"Where is your mistress?" he asked, quietly.</p>

<p>It was the question for which Mary, and
the whole household, had been waiting.</p>

<p>"Why, sir," she answered falteringly, dismayed
now that the matter was coming to a
crisis, "she has gone out&mdash;with Miss Nell, sir&mdash;and
with Mr. McGrew."</p>

<p>McGrew! The name roared in Jim's
brain. The man who had insulted his wife,
whom he had beaten and driven from his
home like a whipped cur.... And Lou and
Nell had gone with Dan McGrew. He felt
a sickness, inexpressibly more horrible than
the physical nausea that had sickened him
there in Murphy's saloon. That Lou should
have gone with Dan McGrew&mdash;and Nell!
The thing was incredible!</p>

<p>His eyes searched the room, as if looking
for wife or child, or for some clew to explain
the mystery. They fell on the envelope,
which he still held in his hand. He tore it
open in a frenzy of eagerness.</p>

<p>He read confusedly. But, somehow, the<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
essential meaning beat upon his brain. He
grasped the fact that the woman he loved had
gone from him. It was all a monstrous lie,
of course. Yet, there was the horrid truth&mdash;she
had gone away. Lou and Nell&mdash;the two
things in the world&mdash;had gone away. He
could not understand. But they had gone.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Jim!"</p>

<p>She had written that, and she had signed it
"Lou." There was confusion in his thoughts.
He could not guess the meaning that lay back
of what his wife had written. He only knew
that there was some monstrous lie.</p>

<p>The maid's voice came softly. The girl
was appalled at the expression on the man's
face as he stood staring down at the sheet of
paper in his hands. It was from a desire to
bring things back to the ordinary that she
spoke apologetically:</p>

<p>"Your glass of water, sir."</p>

<p>The words made a mechanical impression
on Jim Maxwell's consciousness. He
stretched out his left arm, and his hand, from
which he had not yet pulled off the riding-gauntlet,<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
closed over the glass on the tray.
He raised it toward his lips. His eyes fell on
the note once more.</p>

<p>"You love another, so will perhaps not miss
me."</p>

<p>The incredible words were there before
him. And she had gone&mdash;she and Nell....
With Dan McGrew! The thing was impossible.
There was no truth anywhere. He
stared down at the letter, aghast at the horrible
conundrum propounded to him by fate.
Lou had gone&mdash;with Dan McGrew!...
Why?</p>

<p>His eyes held to the note.</p>

<p>"&mdash;so I am going away."</p>

<p>The words beat a refrain of dreadfulness in
his brain.</p>

<p>"&mdash;so I am going away."</p>

<p>His hand, holding the glass of water,
clenched fiercely in the reflex of emotion.
The glass was shivered, and the fragments
were multiplied as his passion still sought expression
in the violence of that clutch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:348px">
 <a href="images/p115f.jpg">
 <img border="0" src="images/p115t.jpg" width="348" height="227" alt="p115t" title="" />
 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">HIS HAND CLENCHED FIERCELY IN THE REFLEX OF EMOTION.</p>

<p>Jim turned to the maid, who had watched
his unconscious splintering of the glass with
distended eyes.</p>

<p>"When did they go?" he asked.</p>

<p>Mary answered hurriedly, disconcerted by
the obvious distress of her master.</p>

<p>"It was some hours ago, sir. They went
sort of unexpected-like, as it seemed to me,
sir."</p>

<p>Jim reasoned swiftly. Somehow, he sensed
a frightful fraud underlying this mystery.
But he knew the need of haste. By some
malevolent chance, his wife had been led into
this error of understanding&mdash;out of which she
had written:</p>

<p>"I do not want to be in your path, so am
going away."</p>

<p>Jim turned to the girl, who was still hovering
doubtfully in the doorway.</p>

<p>"There's been a mistake somewhere, I
guess." His voice was quiet, but in it
throbbed a heart-beat of deepest feeling.
"Tell the foreman, I want the boys to ride with
me to-night."<span class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p>As the cavalcade passed from the driveway
into the high road, which ran east
and west, Dan McGrew spoke quickly.</p>

<p>"We'll ride toward the town."</p>

<p>Lou turned her horse obediently, according
to his direction.</p>

<p>"But why?" she demanded, wonderingly.
"We might meet&mdash;him."</p>

<p>"That's a risk we must run," was the decisive
answer. "When we are well out of
sight of the house, we'll cut around through
the fields, and get back into the road below.
So, if they come after us, they'll start the pursuit
in the wrong way."</p>

<p>In this fashion, the matter was carried out.
Half an hour later, the three were back on
the high-road, riding in the direction opposite
to that in which they had started. They went
forward rapidly through the hot hours of the<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
afternoon, but not too rapidly, in order that
the horses might hold out for the long journey.
Nell, from time to time, would have questioned
her mother over this strange outing.
She became a little petulant, fretful from
balked curiosity. But the mother was not
minded to explain as yet. It required all her
powers of self-control to maintain a fair degree
of composure in this time of trial. She
knew that any attempt to make plausible explanations
to the girl would overtax her
strength, and cause collapse.</p>

<p>Night drew down on the travelers. With
its coming, the storm, which had been threatening
in the sultry air, broke furiously.
Within the minute, the three were drenched.
Dan was disturbed by the discomfort thus inflicted
on mother and child, as well as himself,
but pressed on stubbornly, since no relief was
possible. Presently, however, as he asked a
question concerning roads and distances, Lou
had an inspiration:</p>

<p>"We can cut off eight or ten miles by not
going through Salisbury, to which this road<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
runs. We can ford the river, and beyond it's
open range to Hoytsville. Then we'll strike
the high-road again."</p>

<p>Dan questioned her closely, and was convinced
by her replies.</p>

<p>"I've ridden it often with&mdash;with Jim," she
said. There was a catch in her throat at utterance
of the name. "I think it would be
quite safe, even in the dark."</p>

<p>Dan agreed as to the advisability of her
plan. Presently, then, the three turned out of
the road, and moved toward the river, which,
Lou explained, ran through a little valley just
beyond. The rain had ceased as suddenly as
it had begun. The passing of the storm had
cleared the air. The oppressive heat of the
afternoon and evening was gone. Now, a
chill breeze was blowing. It pierced the
drenched garments of the three, so that they
shivered with cold. Lou became alarmed lest
Nell should suffer some ill consequence from
this exposure. As they descended the slope
that ran down to the river-bank, she spoke suddenly.<span class="pagenum">[117]</span></p>

<p>"Let's stop here for a little rest," she suggested;
and her voice was so anxious that Dan
hardly dared refuse. For that matter, he had
had something of the sort in his own mind.</p>

<p>"It's imprudent," he answered; "but, if we
must, why, we must, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I don't think it's really imprudent," Lou
maintained. "There are trees and bushes
along the river-bank to hide us and the horses.
Anyhow, we're out of sight from the road.
Could you build a fire?"</p>

<p>"If I can find any wood dry enough to
burn," was the rather doubtful response.</p>

<p>They halted on the edge of a grove, which
grew close to the river. Dan led the horses
within the concealment of the trees, and tied
them as best he could with his chilled fingers.
He had difficulty in finding dry leaves and
branches for the fire, but, in the end, succeeded
in making a blaze. Soon, the three
were grouped close around the flame, grateful
for the heat, which relaxed their stiffened
muscles, and sent up steaming vapors from
their wet garments. After a little, Dan left<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
the fire for a look at the river, which was to
be forded at this point. He could see only
very indistinctly, for scudding masses of black
cloud hid moon and stars. As nearly as he
could make out, the river was about fifty yards
in width, its surface almost flush with the bank
on which he stood. In the darkness of the
night, the vaguely seen stream appeared somehow
disquieting, as if in treacherous waiting
Dan McGrew, looking on it, felt a shiver that
was not from the cold. He turned away, with
an impatient curse for his moment of weakness.
Lou had said that the utmost depth of
water in this shallow creek would not reach
to the stirrups. Yet, despite self-contempt
over his feelings, Dan experienced a depression
of spirit for which he could in no wise account,
as he returned to the fire.</p>

<p>It was perhaps an hour after their arrival
in the grove that the man's alert ears caught
a thudding of hoofs upon the high-road from
which they had turned aside. He listened
and made sure that the riders&mdash;for there were
several&mdash;were following the road toward Salisbury<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
and Hoytsville, at full speed. Had
they been going in the opposite direction, they
could have been disregarded. But, under the
circumstances, their presence seemed a sure indication
that pursuit in the right direction had
been begun. To escape them, it would be
necessary to press forward with all haste, taking
advantage of Lou's plan for a shorter distance.</p>

<p>Even while his thoughts were formulating
this decision, Dan had taken prompt measures
of precaution against discovery. He had scattered
the glowing embers with thrusts of his
feet, and had stamped upon them, until they
were completely extinguished.</p>

<p>"We must ride instantly," he said, in an
authoritative voice to Lou, who acquiesced at
once. For she, too, had heard the galloping
through the night and had guessed its meaning.</p>

<p>Dan hurried to unfasten and lead out the
horses. When he was come to the place
where he had tied them, he could distinguish
in the faint light only the two larger mounts.<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
Instantly, the apprehension that had been so
formless crystallized in definite fear of a possibility,
which, in the following moment, was
proven fact. Dan cursed again over the
clumsiness of his cold-stiffened fingers, which
had caused such a mishap. More than ever,
now, he detested the presence of the child with
him and Lou, for it was likely to prove a serious
encumbrance in their further flight. He
called softly, but there came no nicker of response
from the pony. He explained to Lou
and Nell what had happened, and, at his request,
the girl called, in hope that her pet
would hear the summons and obey her voice,
if not another's. But, again, there was no response.
A search, Dan knew, would be useless,
since the escaped pony might be already
miles distant, on its way to the ranch.</p>

<p>"I'll take Nell on behind me," Dan announced
roughly. "It's the only way."</p>

<p>Within a minute, Lou and Dan were
mounted. Then, Dan bent over, and swung
the girl up to a seat behind him.<span class="pagenum">[121]</span></p>

<p>"Hold on tight," he commanded.</p>

<p>The girl obeyed passively. What with the
cold and the soaking and the loss of her pony,
and this dreadful river which they were about
to enter, and the strangeness of everything, the
child was frightened and miserable. She was
sobbing very softly, and the sound irritated
Dan McGrew.</p>

<p>"You lead, Lou," he ordered, "since you
know the way. You can see well enough?"
he asked anxiously. "You're sure that you
know the way?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the confident reply. "But the
water is higher than I've ever seen it. Why,
it's up level with the bank, almost."</p>

<p>"Is it safe, then?" Dan demanded.</p>

<p>"We must risk it, anyhow," Lou returned.
"If we go by the road now, they'll be waiting
for us ahead."</p>

<p>"If the creek's as shallow as you said, I
guess we can manage it, all right," was the
man's decision. "There must have been a
cloud-burst somewhere in the mountains<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
where the stream rises. We got the tail end of
the storm&mdash;and that was a plenty!" he added
savagely. "Let's be off."</p>

<p>Lou led the way as he had bidden her. She
rode a furlong down the bank of the stream,
to a point beyond the grove where she and her
husband had entered the water for the crossing.
As the horse stepped reluctantly down
the shelving bank into the current, a qualm of
dismay stirred in the woman. She could not
doubt that the rush of the water as it came
swirling about the horse's legs was much more
violent than it had been on those other occasions
when she had ridden through it. And,
too, there was something strangely dispiriting
in the combined effects of the black tide and
the ominous gloom of the night beneath a
heaven hidden by the masses of scurrying
clouds. She looked back, as her horse advanced
with laggard pace into the deepening
water. She craved the comfort of companionship
in this horrible time and place. Her
eyes could make out only a silhouette that
moved a little way behind her. She could not<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
perceive any detail there in the darkness. But
she knew that Dan McGrew rode close at
hand, and with him, though invisible, rode her
daughter, Nell&mdash;the one thing dear left to her
in all the world. So, she went forward
bravely enough, though her mood was as black
as the blackness of the night that hung upon
her in a smothering pall of weariness.</p>

<p>The water deepened and flowed with more
fierceness. It reached to the horse's belly.
The steed snorted in affright. Then, it lost
its footing, and sank until only its head, with
the nostrils lifted high, was clear of the water.
Lou cried out at the shock, as she found herself
immersed in the coil of waters. But, even
as she screamed, she threw herself out of the
saddle, to relieve the mare of her weight, and
swam, holding to the pommel of the saddle.
Her horse fought its way forward, breasting
the flood valiantly. At an oblique angle to
the force of the current, the woman and her
steed won slowly to the shore.... Her own
cry and the splash of her body, as she threw
herself from the saddle, had shut from the<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
mother's ears another shriek that had broken
the silence of the night.</p>

<p>Dan's mount, troubled by its increased burden,
was more reluctant even than Lou's had
been to advance through the lashing currents
of the swollen river. It had held back, in
spite of Dan's urging, so that it was at some
distance in the rear, when, at last, it slipped,
and scrambled wildly to regain its footing&mdash;only
to fail and plunge beneath the surface,
borne down by the weight it carried. It was
in the second before the two riders were finally
submerged that Nell voiced her terror in a
shrill cry. The noise of it rang in Dan's ears,
confusing him. But it was strangled in the
second of its birth by the enveloping waters.
As he struggled out of the saddle, holding his
breath, Dan became aware that the girl was
no longer on the horse. She was not clinging
to him. She had gone from him out into
the mystery of the black night and the hungry
river. He realized that her cry had been that
of despair, as the force of the current wrested
the child from her hold on horse and man.<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
Dan's head came above the surface, and he
floated easily enough, supported by a hand on
the swimming horse. Even his iron nerves
were shaken by the calamity. There was no
further sound out of the stillness of the night,
save the rippling murmur of the water as the
horse swam onward. Dan was aware that he
could do nothing toward the girl's rescue.
Already, the hurrying current must have
carried her far beyond his reach. It seemed
clear enough that Nell must have lost consciousness
at once after being swept down into
the element. Otherwise, she must have cried
out again&mdash;and there had come no second cry.
Strong man as he was, Dan McGrew felt himself
helpless in the grasp of circumstance.
There was nothing that he could do to avert
or to mitigate the tragedy. He could only go
forward helplessly, leaving the unfortunate
girl to her fate. The suddenness, as well as
the dreadfulness of the catastrophe, sickened
him. Later on, he might rejoice over this
summary removal of one who must have
proved an obstacle in his path. But, just now,<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
his emotion was of dismay&mdash;a dismay strange
to his experience. Beyond the natural horror
aroused in him by the accident, Dan
McGrew found himself almost in despair over
what must come to pass when the mother
should learn of her daughter's death. He
knew well that Nell was the one treasure that
remained in the mother's heart. The loss of
this last possession would rend her being to
its depths, and leave her utterly desolate. The
first effect from knowledge of the tragedy
would be that the mother would not go a step
further, until after the river had been
searched, and her daughter's body recovered.
Such a delay would be fatal to the plotter's
every hope.... At once, Dan McGrew forgot
his horror, his despair. He began again
his plotting&mdash;to the end that the mother should
not learn the truth too soon.</p>

<p>When, finally, his horse gained a footing,
near the other bank of the river, Dan McGrew
had matured a plan to suffice for the
moment. Beyond that, he could not see his
way. The future lay in the lap of the gods.<span class="pagenum">[127]</span></p>

<p>On dry land again, Dan reined in the horse,
which welcomed the respite gladly after its
battling with the river. He listened, and soon
heard Lou calling his name. From the sound
of her voice, he knew that she was at some distance
from him, further up the stream. He
sent a cheery shout in answer to her hail.
Then, he rode forward slowly and cautiously
through the darkness, which was so deep that
he could hardly see to pick a way among the
bushes and trees that lined the bank of the
creek. And Dan McGrew blessed fate for
that darkness. Lou's voice came again, near
at hand. Now, Dan could perceive the vague
outline of her form against the background
of the sky, as she sat her horse on the crest of
the little knoll that rose from the river's
brim.</p>

<p>"We're all right," he cried, and his voice
was full of content. "But I don't think much
of your easy ford, Lou. It was a nasty crossing."
Then his voice rang sharply, imperiously:
"But we must hurry on, if we are to
gain anything for all our trouble."<span class="pagenum">[128]</span></p>

<p>"And you're all right, then?" Lou asked.
There was a note of vast relief in her voice.
"You're all right, you&mdash;and Nell?"</p>

<p>Dan McGrew's voice came with an emphasis
of sincerity:</p>

<p>"We're all right, Nell and I." Again his
voice came insistently:</p>

<p>"Ride on, Lou. We'll follow."</p>

<p>Lou called out once again, and the music
of her voice was very tender:</p>

<p>"It will only be for a little longer, Nell.
Mother's brave darling!"</p>

<p>Dan's voice came roughly, to cover the lack
of any response from the child.</p>

<p>"Hurry, Lou! Hurry! We'll follow."</p>

<p>Wholly unsuspicious, Lou rode on her way
amid the shadows of the night. She had no
least instinct to warn her that now, at last, she
had lost everything her life had held dear.
There was still the torture that had come when
she had learned the baseness of her husband.
But she could not guess the last evil that was
upon her. So, she rode swiftly through the
night. Always, even when they came into the<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
road at Hoytsville, Dan rode a little in the
rear. Lou looked back from time to time.
She could see the outlines of man and horse.
She could not see the form of her daughter;
the bulk of the man hid even its shadow from
her eyes. But the fact that she could not see
caused no fear in her, and she rode swiftly, as
contented as one may be when the sweetness of
life has changed to abomination.</p>

<p>It was not till they came to the outskirts of
the little city, through which the main line of
the railroad ran, that Lou learned the truth.
It was under the lights of the streets that she
turned, and looked, and saw Dan McGrew
close behind her&mdash;and saw that there was none
clinging at his back. She stared disbelievingly.
Then, a ghastly fear leaped within
her.</p>

<p>"Nell!" she cried.</p>

<p>Her voice was strained and shrill, broken
with dread. "Nell!" she repeated, in a tone
muffled by terror. "Where is she?" She
turned her horse sharply and reined it to Dan
McGrew's side. Motionless, the two regarded<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
each other through seconds that were
as ages.</p>

<p>Finally, Dan McGrew spoke:</p>

<p>"She was torn away when we were swept
under," he said; and his voice was very compassionate.
"I did what I could. There was
no way to save her. She only cried out once.
She must have gone down immediately."</p>

<p>Lou sat rigid, gazing with eyes that widened
and burned in flames under which the man before
her cringed. And then, of a sudden, the
fires of her gaze were quenched. It was as if
a black flood rolled over her as well, and extinguished
the very last sparks of her spirit.
The lids slowly fluttered down to closing.
Under the blue white of the arc-light, her
face was that of a dead woman. The last
blow of fate in that frightful day had overwhelmed
her. She tottered in her saddle.
Dan McGrew, watching fearfully this thing
that had come to pass through his machinations,
leaped, and stood, and caught the fainting
woman as she fell.</p>

<p>He remained motionless there for a full<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
minute, with the lifeless body in his arms.
For once, he found himself perplexed, incompetent.
But, abruptly, his thoughts cleared.
Something of his usual self-confidence, so
greatly shaken this night, came back to him.
He smiled with a cruel, utterly selfish satisfaction.</p>

<p>"It's the best way out," he muttered to himself.
"I'll get her into some quiet place.
She'll need a lot of nursing before she gets
over all this. I'm sorry for Lou, but it had
to be; and it's all for the best."</p>

<p>With that monstrous declaration concerning
the evil that he had wrought, Dan
McGrew strode forward toward the nearest
house, carrying the unconscious woman in his
arms.<span class="pagenum">[132]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>Jim and his men rode throughout the
night in vain. Nowhere could they
come on any trace of the fugitives. There
was as yet no telephone installed in this newly
settled region. But their search was thorough.
There were inquiries at the railway
stations in the various towns round about. At
none of these had ought been seen of Dan
McGrew and woman and child. Jim found
himself baffled in his quest. He could not
guess that the wife who had thus deserted him
was lying in a stupor, from which she aroused
only to rave over a lost husband and a dead
child. He could not know that she had
broken under the stress of sorrow, and was
being ministered unto by a kindly woman to
whom Dan McGrew had told many lies, in
order to enlist her sympathetic aid. Even had
his inquiries reached the very house in which<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
Lou was sheltered, he would still have been
deceived. For he sought a mother and her
child: and here was no child.</p>

<p>So, the hunt availed nothing. The three
who fled had vanished utterly. There came
not even a rumor as to their whereabouts.
They were gone as completely as if the earth
had opened and swallowed them up.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Jim was not slow in learning
something of the truth. He was told of Dan's
visit at the ranch that fatal day, and of his
wife's accompanying this visitor to the town.
Those there were who had seen the two as
they dismounted at Murphy's saloon, and
looked in through the window. Jim, remembering
his own experiences of that day in the
back room of the saloon, was aroused to suspicion
of the fact. He got from the bar-keeper
details as to what had occurred. The
fellow's reference, jestingly made, to the manner
in which Jim and the woman, Jess, had
embraced, gave him a sudden illumination
concerning the plot of Dan McGrew by which
his wife had been beguiled.<span class="pagenum">[134]</span></p>

<p>Straightway, Jim hunted out Fingie Whalen's
woman. She would have denied, but, in
the face of the injured husband's rage, she was
fairly terrified into confession. In the end,
the woman wrote at Jim's dictation, even as
she had written at the dictation of Dan
McGrew. But, now, she wrote without any
smirk of vicious satisfaction&mdash;with a face pallid
and with fingers that trembled from fear
of the fierce-visaged man who stood over her
in stern and menacing domination. Fingie
Whalen, all his bluster gone, looked on in
timid consternation, cringing from the baleful
threat in the eyes of the man mortally
wronged.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:347px">
 <a href="images/p140f.jpg">
 <img border="0" src="images/p140t.jpg" width="347" height="222" alt="p140t" title="" />
 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">SHE WOULD HAVE DENIED, BUT WAS FAIRLY TERRIFIED INTO CONFESSION.</p>

<p>The painted woman was so moved by the
anger of the man whom she had helped betray,
that, for the first time in more years than she
would have cared to tell, she revealed the name
with which, back in a quiet New England village,
she had been christened by simple, God-fearing
parents.</p>

<p>This was the note of confession, which the<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
woman wrote at Jim's command, duly dated,
and witnessed by Fingie Whalen and the landlady
of the house, who was summoned for the
purpose. Jim realized that these formalities
were extravagant, but, somehow, they seemed
necessary to him just then, to put this evidence
of the crime against his home and happiness
beyond cavil of doubt.</p>

<blockquote><p>I, Anne Weston, confess to tricking Jim
Maxwell and deceiving his wife at the instigation
of Dan McGrew. McGrew hired
Fingie Whalen and me to help him fool Mrs.
Maxwell. I wrote the note signed "Jess."
At the time when Mr. Maxwell was due to arrive
in town, I was all ready, and as he came
by fell from my horse as if I had fainted. He
carried me into the saloon, and then Fingie
gave him knock-out drops, and we fixed it up
so that when McGrew came with Mrs. Maxwell
and looked in at the window, it was as
if we were loving together. But it was all a
lie, worked out by Dan McGrew to make
Mrs. Maxwell believe her husband was false
to her.</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">Anne Weston.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum">[136]</span></p>

<p>Jim carried that paper in his pocket. It
was the document with which he would prove
to Lou how she had been deluded. But the
days passed, and there came no opportunity to
show her the sheet of paper on which Anne
Weston had scrawled her confession. He
used every means at his command, but he was
powerless to gain any trace of the woman
whom he had loved and lost through despicable
treachery.</p>

<p>It was on the fourth day after Lou had fled
her home, that Jim Maxwell seated himself
at the piano in the living-room. Hitherto, he
had been so occupied in the vain effort to find
his wife that he had been, in some measure,
unappreciative of the misery that was upon
him. Now, when he had exhausted every resource
of activity, he suddenly felt the desolation
of his home&mdash;the ruin of his life. With
his instinct toward the musical expression of
moods, he took his place before the instrument.</p>

<p>Then, again, that glorious love-lyric came
softly sonorous from the keys. The lilt of the
melody rose and fell with a subtle vigor, instinct
with the joy of life. The delicate tenderness
of the music throbbed the story of a
love complete and enduring. There was passion
in the rhythm. It was a passion ennobled
and purified by the intricate harmonies woven
around and within it. It was a song of the
spirit. It was overlaid with a splendor of
sensuous sound. There was nothing gross&mdash;only
the fullness of life.... Jim was playing
with exquisite art that song of happiness which
he had improvised on the day he received the
news of Dan McGrew's coming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[137]</span></p>

<p>Now, after he had followed the melody to
its end, the truth, which during the moments
of his playing he had forgotten, crashed upon
him in a discord so horrible that he could not
touch the keys to voice it&mdash;could only sit,
moveless, listening to the din within his own
soul in an ecstasy of despair.</p>

<p>Often, again, in the years to come, Jim Maxwell
played that same melody. Always, he
was searching for the wife whom he had loved
and lost. Men whose eyes were sharp noted<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
him here and there around the world, because
he seemed so uninterested in everything, and
because so often his left hand touched his
breast.... In the pocket there, he carried,
ready for Lou's reading, the confession signed
by Anne Weston&mdash;the woman Jess.</p>

<p>And, in the years as they passed, Jim Maxwell
gained something of reputation for another
thing. He traveled the world over; he
had money enough. His foreman was competent.
Even without his personal attendance,
the revenues from the ranch increased
year by year. He lived for only two things:
to find Lou and prove to her his innocence&mdash;and
to kill the man who had betrayed them.
In his search, Jim Maxwell went everywhere.
He was known in the capitals of Europe; he
was known in the wild places of the earth.
Men spoke of him, though they had little
acquaintance with him. The reason they
spoke of him was because on occasion&mdash;it
might be in the parlor of some sailor's lodging-house
in Vladivostok, or it might be in a
drawing-room of the Savoy, this man would<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
seat himself at the piano, and he would play.
And, always, he played the self-same melody,
a lilting air of love and tenderness, filled full
of the joy of life. Always, too, the melody
was embroidered over with an intricate web
of harmonies, magnificent, yet somber. And,
in the end, always, the player beat suddenly
upon the keys a frenzy of discord.<span class="pagenum">[140]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>"Then you're quite sure, Jack? You
don't mind my being a&mdash;nobody?"
The girl's tone was half-playful, half-sad.
There was a note of wistfulness in the musical
cadences of her voice.</p>

<p>The young man whom she had addressed
answered with an emphasis that left no doubt
as to his sincerity. His clear gray eyes were
alight with love, as he looked into the dark,
gypsy-like face of the girl at his side.</p>

<p>"Why, Nell, you're just everybody.
You're everything worth while in this little
old world of ours."</p>

<p>"You do say the sweetest things, Jack!"
The shadowy eyes that met tenderly the warm
gaze of the lover were lighted with fond appreciation.
Then, of a sudden, the red lips
trembled into a mischievous smile, as she
added: "I guess I wouldn't give a snap for<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
a sweetheart who was tongue-tied when he
talked about my charms."</p>

<p>The two were seated in the main room of
a small, roughly-built Alaskan cabin, which
stood on the outskirts of a ramshackle village,
created almost in a day by the gold lure's
magic. The lovers had been left alone together
on the eve of their wedding-day by the
kindness of the girl's foster parents, Mr. and
Mrs. Ross. It was of these, who, in the tiny
back room, were recalling the distant days of
their own courtship, that Nell now spoke.</p>

<p>"They have been so good to me!" she said
musingly. "I've told you that they were not
really and truly my parents. I didn't tell you
just how I came to be with them, because it
was such a dreadful time to me. Even after
all these years, I hate thinking of it."</p>

<p>"Don't!" Jack Reeves urged. "What's past
is past, and there's no earthly reason for you
to worry yourself over it by telling me."</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you, dear," she said simply.
Then she fell silent for a little. The lover,<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
watching the warm olive contour of the cheek
against which the long black lashes swept as
her eyes closed in meditation, rejoiced yet
once again in the beauty and the daintiness of
this maiden whom he had found and won for
himself here amid the rigors of the Northland.
He noted the slight drooping of the
tenderly curving lips, and longed to kiss away
their sadness. Presently Nell went on speaking,
rather rapidly, as if anxious to be done
with an unpleasant task, and in a tone that told
of restrained emotion:</p>

<p>"It was twelve years ago that Papa and
Mamma Ross found me. You know Papa
Ross is a born pioneer, and Mamma has grown
to be just like him. For years they have been
moving with the frontiers. That time they
were camping by a river down below. There
had been a heavy storm, and the river ran high.
They heard a cry from somewhere out in the
night on the water. They ran to the bank
and looked. But it was dark, and they
couldn't see anything or hear another sound.<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
Rover was with them&mdash;a splendid big Newfoundland."
The girl's voice softened.
"Rover died two years ago, just before we
came up here. I loved him so!"</p>

<p>"I think I can guess," Jack ventured, as the
girl paused. "It was Rover who saved you&mdash;for,
of course, it was you out there in the
river."</p>

<p>The girl nodded somberly.</p>

<p>"Yes," came her answer, very gently uttered;
"I was out there in the river, drowning.
The current swept me along with it. There
was a point of the shore just below where
Papa Ross had camped. I was carried into
the eddies there. Somehow, Rover caught a
glimpse of my face, or, maybe, just his instinct
guided him. Anyhow, as Papa Ross has told
me, Rover sprang into the river, and, when
Papa Ross had followed around the inlet toward
the point, he found the dog trying to
drag me out of the water, up on the bank.
Papa Ross carried me to the camp, and there
he and Mamma worked over me for a long<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
time. It was a close call, Papa Ross says, but
finally they got me to breathing again....
And that's about all."</p>

<p>"And so," Jack questioned in some surprise,
"you don't know any more than that?&mdash;where
you came from, or anything?"</p>

<p>Once again Nell shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, nothing more than that. Papa Ross
always thought that I must have struck my
head somehow, there in the water. Anyhow,
I was confused when I came to. I couldn't
seem to remember anything exactly&mdash;except
my name, Nell. Sometimes I have shadowy
memories, but they melt away before I can
get anything definite. So, you see, I'm just a
nobody, Jack, as I told you&mdash;just a mystery
that came out of the night and the river."</p>

<p>"Everybody to me," the lover declared
again; "everything to me." And now, at last,
he took the lithe, slender form of the girl into
his arms, and kissed the sorrowfully drooping
lips to smiles again.</p>

<p>But, after a little, when there came a lull in
the caresses and murmured endearments, Jack<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
Reeves spoke a question that was puzzling
him:</p>

<p>"But I should think it would have been
easy enough to trace you? If inquiries had
been made, surely you might have learned
where you came from, and who you were, and
all that?"</p>

<p>But, once again, Nell shook her head, and
this time very emphatically.</p>

<p>"Papa Ross did what he could, but it came
to nothing. When we got to a town, he tried
to find out about any girl's being lost like that.
Nobody knew of any such case. There was
no report of any child's having been drowned.
He did what he could&mdash;I'm sure of that.
Anyhow, as long as you don't care, Jack, I
don't suppose I need to. But, somehow&mdash;" Nell's
voice broke, and she sat silent, absorbed
in melancholy reverie. Always, this mystery
was a painful thing to her. Even now, when
her happiness was full, on the eve of her marriage
to the man she loved, she was grieved
by the fact that she must come to her husband
as a waif, a creature whose origin was unknown,<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
a nameless bit of flotsam, dragged
from the river by a dog. Then, in another
moment, the depression of her mood was forgotten
as she drew away from Jack's embrace,
for she heard Papa Ross stamping heavily
about the back room of the cabin&mdash;in kindly
warning that he was about to intrude upon
the lovers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning broke clear, and when at
last the slowly clambering sun rose to traverse
its short circle between the horizons, its slanting
beams seemed full of warmth and good
cheer, though the mercury stood at twenty degrees
below zero. There was not a breath of
wind, and the chill air, pure with a purity
unknown to lower latitudes, was like the wine
of life. The breath of it in the lungs set the
blood a-tingle with joyousness. And the
purity of the air had for its background
the visible purity of the snow-mantle that lay
over everything. Beneath the sun, the white
expanse shimmered in prismatic brilliance.
Afar, the mountains loomed in purple masses&mdash;the<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
green of conifers seen through the vista
of many miles.</p>

<p>And the day, in its spirit of vigorous life
and wholesome gayety, was suited to the mood
of the tiny temporary town, which sprawled
here in the wilderness. For the place was en
f&ecirc;te. The hardy men who had thus ventured
into the wilds of the North welcomed the diversion
of this romance among them, which
was to culminate to-day in the wedding of
Jack Reeves and Nell Ross at the Dyea Hotel.
Public sentiment had insisted that the nuptials
should be celebrated at the hotel. The hotel,
truth to tell, was neither commodious nor imposing.
But it was a boarded structure, the
only one in the village, and it was by far the
largest, small though it was. And the citizens
were determined that they should be
permitted to assemble in force on this auspicious
day, when the glamour of love was to
soften in some degree the austerity of the
arctic land. So, betimes, the men of the community
gathered at the hotel to await the marriage
ceremony. A scant half-dozen women,<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
courageous followers of the men they loved,
were there as well. Some had been at pains
to bring heaps of evergreen boughs, and with
these the main room of the hotel&mdash;at once
lobby, bar and office&mdash;was decorated. Caribou
Bill brought a great bank of moss, for
which he had dug through six feet of snow.
To it was attached a piece of flaming-red
paper, in which tea had originally been
packed, and this paper had been laboriously
cut by Caribou Bill into the shape of two
hearts, lovingly joined as one. The symbol
of wedded happiness was established by its
smirking inventor on the central shelf above
the bar, where it commanded the enthusiastic
admiration of the populace.</p>

<p>It was noon to the second when Nell Ross
and Jack Reeves stood in the center of the
main room of the hotel before the one who
was to make them man and wife. He, too,
was at heart a pioneer, and he was, as well,
an earnest worker for the saving of souls.
His own preference, with a roving commission,
had brought him to this remote place.<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
He found a singular pleasure in the fact that
his ministrations were required for the uniting
of this winsome maiden and this virile, clean
young man. It was as if the ceremony typified
in some fashion the purity and vigor of
life here within the frozen North.... It
was noon to the second! The time-keeper
was Harry, the Dog-Man, who carried a
Waterbury watch, on the accuracy of which
he would cheerfully have staked his hopes of
eternal happiness. Because of the exactness
of his time-piece, which none cared to deny,
he had usurped the office of master of ceremonies.
When he saw the two hands of the
watch blent as one upon the hour of twelve, he
raised his arm, and Nell and Jack moved forward
within the little lane walled by the
crowd, to stand before the clergyman, who
regarded them with a benevolent smile, in
which, unknown to himself, was something almost
of envy in the presence of their youth
and happiness and love.</p>

<p>So, the minister spoke the words that made
this pair husband and wife.<span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>

<p>There was a noise of snapping dogs outside.
A man came into the hotel, stamping the snow
from the high-buckled overshoes worn over
his boots of felt. Behind him came a woman
muffled in furs. She looked on the scene with
a certain feminine interest, for she realized at
once that a wedding was in progress; but
without any personal concern. Indeed, she
was rather displeased, being weary from a
long journey over the snows, because she saw
that she must wait for attention until the ceremony
should be concluded. The man with
her shook the hood of the parka from his
head, and stood regarding with cynical amusement
the two who had clasped hands before
the clergyman. So he waited while the
words were uttered that made the pair one.
The ceremony ended, the husband kissed the
bride; the minister in turn bent and touched
his lips to hers, with a curious stirring of half-forgotten
emotions.</p>

<p>Then the crowd surged forward, eager for
its prerogative of a kiss. And, as she turned,<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
Nell saw the man who had just entered, standing
there with that smile of cynical amusement
upon his handsome face. The eyes of
the two met and battled. There came to her
a strange feeling of dread. In this, the supreme
moment of her life, wherein all had
been happiness, there stirred a feeling of
doubt, of evil anticipation.</p>

<p>The man, staring into the face of this beautiful
girl upon whose nuptials he had stumbled
by chance, experienced a thrill of emotion
which he could not understand. Some secret
monition moved him to an alarm. He felt an
unreasonable disturbance in the presence of
this girl.... Dan McGrew had no suspicion
that he had blundered thus on the child
who, years before, had been swept away from
him in the darkness of the river's flood-tide....
Nor did the woman, who stood behind
him so wearily, waiting for the end of this
tiresome ceremony, guess that the gentle girl,
blushing there under the storm of kisses
claimed by the crowd, was, in fact, the daughter<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
for whose death she had mourned through
so many years.... Nell did not see the
woman at all.</p>

<p class="h5">"THEY'VE STRUCK IT RICH ON FORGOTTEN CREEK!"</p>

<p>Of a sudden there came an interruption:</p>

<p>A man leaped through the doorway. He
waved his hands and staggered as one
drunken. His voice rose in a raucous shriek:</p>

<p>"They've struck it rich on Forgotten
Creek!"</p>

<p>There was a moment of intense stillness.
These men had fled from civilization in pursuit
of the will-o'-the-wisp of gold. Now
sounded the clarion call:</p>

<p>"They've struck it rich on Forgotten
Creek!"</p>

<p class="h5">THESE MEN HAD FLED FROM CIVILIZATION IN PURSUIT OF THE WILL-'O-THE WISP OF GOLD.</p>

<p>For long seconds the stillness endured.
Then, abruptly, there came a huge cachinnation.
It was the mellow, roaring laughter of
Bert Black, the only negro in this Aladdin
village so close up under the Pole. The company
looked at the man expectantly, and he
answered the interrogation in their eyes:<span class="pagenum">[153]</span></p>

<p>"We-all is just shohly goin' to have a stampede!"</p>

<p>Then, again, the silence held for a little,
while each and every man of them saw the
vision of the straggled crowd trailing the
waste places, lured on by the will-o'-the-wisp
of gold.<span class="pagenum">[154]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>The Fates, in weaving the intricate web
of human lives, smile grimly oftentimes
over the curious intermingling of the threads.
Often, too, the incomplete design might well
move them to a cruel mirth, but that they see
beyond the seeming tangle of events to the
perfecting of their pattern at the last. So,
perhaps, they are content of their task, though
we mortals, with short-sighted eyes, seeing
dimly, look on the happenings of our lives as
the blessed or the baneful work of chance.
Thus, now, the Fates had brought here, beneath
the flickering of the Northern Lights, all
the actors in the drama of the years agone,
when the happiness of a home had been shattered
by a villain's ruthless passion. Their
presence within a short radius of miles had
every appearance of purest chance. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
the Fates had brought them within
reach of one another, that thus the seeming
snarl in the threads of these lives might be
shown as in fact untangled and woven into a
design just and harmonious and beautiful.</p>

<p>Dan McGrew moved sociably among the
men of the village, as they celebrated the wedding
with many jovial libations. He was
hail-fellow-well-met with each and all, for it
had come to be a matter of professional necessity
with him to attain a fair measure of
popularity whithersoever he went. He had
deteriorated much with the passage of the
years. He had sunk to be a common gambler,
and on occasion had not scrupled at worse
methods in pursuit of ill-gotten gains. To-day
his keen eyes were speedily drawn to one
of the men, who was especially lavish in hospitality.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" Dan asked of the bar-tender.
"Seems flush, all right."</p>

<p>"That's Sam Ward," was the answer.
"He's got a hole somewhere up in the hills,
which nobody don't know nothin' about&mdash;'cept<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
it's cussed rich. Sam blows a pokeful
o' dust ev'ry time he hits town."</p>

<p>Dan eyed the fortunate prospector greedily,
and his predatory instinct brought him to a
quick decision. He went to Lou, who was
sitting, drearily enough, alone at a table in a
corner of the room. He spoke to her softly,
that none might overhear, though of this there
was little danger amid the noise of rollicking
gayety.</p>

<p>"There's a chap here I mean to chum up
with a bit," Dangerous Dan explained. "I'll
introduce him, and you must be nice enough
to him to make him talk."</p>

<p>The woman nodded assent. For it had
come to such a pass. Often, she had stooped
to play decoy for the man in his schemes
against his fellows.</p>

<p>Dan McGrew had persistently lied to this
woman. By his arts he had ruined her life.
But Lou had still no inkling of the truth.
One great fact was impressed upon her as time
passed: This man loved her&mdash;and he was
loyal to her. Since she had lost everything<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
dear, it seemed her duty to give the worthless
remnant of her life to the one who thus
esteemed it something precious.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Lou returned to consciousness, after
the fever and delirium that seized her the
dreadful night of the flight from home, her
first question was concerning the drowned
child.</p>

<p>The man at the bedside met her imploring
gaze steadfastly, and spoke his falsehoods so
convincingly that she had never a doubt.
The river had been searched with every care,
he declared. The body had not been found.
The bereaved mother had been denied the last
pitiful solace of grief&mdash;a place of burial
wherein to mourn over the lost.</p>

<p>After the final deprivation, Lou was apathetic.
The light had gone out of her life.
She was numb with misery. Her most distinct
emotion was a sort of passive gratitude
toward the man who had so frightfully
wronged her. It was in obedience to the
promptings of this feeling that Lou meekly<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
accepted his every suggestion. She did so
with the more readiness because these suggestions
were so skillfully contrived as to seem
the epitome of unselfishness.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, there was the matter of
divorce. Dan learned that the kindly woman
into whose house he had brought Lou suffered
from nostalgia. She had come out into the
West with an eager, improvident husband,
who had died and left her with this tiny home,
on which the mortgage of a few hundreds
rested as a burden beyond her strength to remove.
She was sick with longing to go back
among the home-folk. Dan's sympathetic
voice and candid, honest eyes won confidence
from the lonely old woman. And, too, she
quickly grew fond of the invalid in her house.
Therefore, she had no hesitation in acceding
to the proposal made to her by Dan McGrew:
that she should travel to the East with Lou, as
nurse and companion. The money offered to
her by Dan McGrew for these services was
enough to ease her declining years. Moreover,
there was the added inducement that, in<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
this manner, she would be able to return to the
place for which she longed.</p>

<p>Lou made no objection to the arrangement.
She liked the old woman, and the instinct of
flight was still upon her.... She was only
grateful to the man who was at such pains in
her behalf.</p>

<p>In due time, the three were duly established
in the East. Dangerous Dan, in the course of
his daily visits to Lou from a lodging he had
taken close at hand, guided her thoughts so
craftily that, with no suspicion of having been
influenced, the heart-broken woman decided
that she should get a divorce. Dan had
chosen a location in a State where desertion
was a sufficient cause. Lou brought suit, and
the issue was expedited in the courts. She believed
that thus she gave to her husband an
opportunity to marry the woman with whom
he had become infatuated, and thus, too, an
opportunity to restore in some degree his self-respect.... She
could not guess that, owing
to the treachery of the man on whose advice
she relied, her husband had no knowledge<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
whatsoever of these proceedings. The newspapers,
with their formal advertisements to
the defendant in the action instituted in the
courts, were never posted to the address of
the ranch-owner.... Dan McGrew saw to
that.</p>

<p>Eventually, there came a decree <i>nisi</i>. In
due time, the divorce was made absolute.
Throughout this interval of delay, the man
demonstrated the firmness of his purpose by
the patience with which he waited for the attainment
of his ends.</p>

<p>It was not until a year after her flight from
home that Lou became the wife of Dangerous
Dan McGrew.... Why should she not give
herself to him who had so befriended her?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The late dawn of the morning after the
wedding came on clear, with a soft wind
blowing from the south. Under its gentleness,
the sun was able to thaw the surface of
the snow. Then the wind swung to the north.
Within an hour, the crust on the snow, as the
Arctic air blew over it, was strong enough
to support a horse. And Dan McGrew and
many another took advantage of the fact.
There were a few meagerly fed horses in the
town, remnants from the discontinued Lodestar
Mine, which had failed to pay a profit,
after elaborate installation of equipment.
They knew that at the first change of the
weather their mounts would become worse
than useless. In the meantime, however,
there was a luxury in this form of travel that
appealed. And there were hangers-on in the
town, too poor for a grub-stake, who for a
pittance would run on foot with the train, and
afterward take back the horses to the village,
when a softer snow should make them a hindrance
rather than a help.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[161]</span></p>

<p>Nell used the voice of wifely authority:</p>

<p>"Why, the idea! Of course I shall go
too!" She was all eagerness. For years she
had lived with those who were informed with
the spirit of the frontiers. Her husband, thus
far in his battling with the Northland, had
been successful. He had found claims of
value. Some of them he had sold; some of<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
them he had worked. From most of them he
had won a deserved profit. So, when the
news of the strike on Forgotten Creek came&mdash;even
though it was his wedding-day&mdash;Jack
Reeves was all agog with anxiety to be off to
this region whither fortune beckoned.... And
Nell would not be left behind. She
would follow her husband where fate led.
She would not be denied.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that the bridal pair
were among the crowd that surged in the village
street before the Dyea Hotel on the
morning after their wedding. Jack had a
team of dogs, the best within hundreds of
miles. They were strong enough to make
play of hauling the long sled, laden with provisions,
on which Nell was seated with ease,
well-wrapped in furs, and sheltered beneath
a drapery of white&mdash;the skin of a polar bear,
which Jack had brought back with him as
a trophy of experiences beneath the Arctic
night.</p>

<p>There were in the throng men who had no<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
dogs. They carried on their backs the small
allowance of bacon, beans, flour, tea, coffee,
sugar, tobacco. The adventurers were of all
sorts. Some went well supplied. Others
joined in the stampede recklessly. They might
starve, or freeze, out there in the mountains.
But they were caught and drawn on by the
lust for riches. Somewhere out there in the
cold and the distance gold was lying. In the
sands of the creeks, in the ledges of the mountains,
were the golden flakes, the riches for
which each and every one craved....</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:357px">

 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">THE ADVENTURERS WERE OF ALL SORTS. THEY WERE DRAWN ON BY THE LUST FOR RICHES.</p>

<p>The huskies yelped and snarled in fierce
rivalry. Harry, the Dog-Man, snapped his
whip with a vicious crack like the report of a
gun. The dogs strained against the breast-straps
in their fierce lunge forward. Along
the line was everywhere impetuous, eager
movement. The stampede had begun.</p>

<p>Dangerous Dan McGrew, who rode beside
his wife, spoke to her softly, so that his question
would not be overheard by Sam Ward,
who rode on her other side:<span class="pagenum">[164]</span></p>

<p>"What does he say?"</p>

<p>Lou answered in a whisper:</p>

<p>"He'll leave to-night, when the camp's
quiet, for his own claim."<span class="pagenum">[165]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p>From a nook on the mountainside, a lone
man watched scornfully the long, thin
line of the stampede.</p>

<p>Those same threads spun by the Fates had
caught another in their mesh. In a lonely
hut, there in the desolate Northland, Jim
Maxwell had his home. His presence was
needful for the weaving of that design by
which right should be realized in the final
presentation of life's tapestry. He had traveled
thus far beyond the confines of civilization
under the urge of that immutable
purpose which drove him in all his wanderings
throughout the years&mdash;to find the man he
hated, and the woman he loved. He had
sought vainly over all the world in the usual
haunts of men&mdash;in many that were unusual.
Never, anywhere, had he found a trace. He
had come into this forbidding land, not for<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
the lure of gold, as the others had come; but
for the lure of vengeance against the man who
had despoiled him, and for the lure of love
toward the woman who had his heart in her
keeping.</p>

<p>Then, somehow, Jim Maxwell, when he
found himself isolated there in a cabin amid
the loneliness of this land, almost forgot vengeance,
almost forgot love, in the immensity
of the peace that brooded over the snow-clad
wastes. In the hut he had built with his own
hands, from spruce timbers, he was snugly
sheltered against the austerities of the clime.
He had fuel enough, of his gathering along
the wooded slopes of the foot-hills. In the
maw of the sheet-iron stove, which he had
packed, the resinous branches were transmuted
into dancing flames, redolent of
warmth and cheer in the tiny room of the
hut, though outside the blasts from the Pole
were cold as the ice from which they
came.</p>

<p>The day of his daughter's wedding&mdash;though
he had no least suspicion that wife, or<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
child, or enemy was within thousands of miles&mdash;Jim
made a round of his traps. In making
the circuit, he was absorbed, without thought,
for the time being, of the life that had
been, without thought of vengeance, without
thought of love. It was only after he had returned
at nightfall to the hut, and had fried
his mess of bacon on top of the red-hot stove,
and had boiled his coffee hard, as one must
in the North, where there is need of all the
energy from food, that Jim sat down on his
bunk of spruce boughs, ready for sleep&mdash;yet,
for a moment, wakeful.</p>

<p>Then there sounded softly on his ears that
old, old lyric of love. It was the song that
had been played out of the feeling of his heart
for his wife, in the years long gone. It was
that improvisation with which he had told
Lou his passion on the day when he had heard
that Dan McGrew was coming to visit them.
Now, Jim had no means of audible expression.
Nevertheless, the song welled in him. It
thrilled in every atom of his being. It was
that same wonderful, joyous, lilting melody,<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
full of life at its best. The tenderness of love
rang in its cadences. Jim's fingers tensed&mdash;they
were hungry to seize the chords, rapacious
to pounce on the notes that voiced this
heart-song of a lost happiness.</p>

<p>Jim aroused from the trance of memory.
He looked to the fire, and rolled into the bunk.... He
had heard, that day, in a native
iglook, of a find of gold on Forgotten Creek.
He recalled the fact drowsily as sleep fell on
him.</p>

<p>"I'll take a look across the valley in the
morning," he thought. "There's sure to be a
stampede."</p>

<p>So it came about on the day following the
marriage of Nell Ross and Jack Reeves that
there was a watcher who looked out over the
valley through which the long line of dogs
and men hurried toward the possible riches of
Forgotten Creek.</p>

<p>Jim seated himself on the trunk of a fallen
spruce, high on the mountainside. From this
point, he overlooked the whole length of the
valley. He saw at last the animate line darting
out of the distance, and watched as it became
definite, with a smile of cynical amusement....
These were the hunters of gold.
And gold&mdash;Bah! There were only two
things in the world: love and vengeance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[169]</span></p>

<p>From his seat on the fallen spruce, Jim
Maxwell stared out over the valley. For
hours he sat there. He saw the breaking up
of the company, as its members scattered in
various directions, now that they were come
into the region of possible wealth. At the
last, the valley showed clear of the human
invaders.... And, just then, Jim Maxwell
heard a sound, which already he had learned
to know, there in the Northland. It was a
gentle sound, but with a sibilance that held a
threat of danger&mdash;like the hiss of a gigantic
serpent.</p>

<p>As he heard, Jim instinctively let out a
great shout of fear in the presence of this
peril so close upon him. In the same moment,
without pausing to look up, he dropped
from the log on which he had been sitting,
and crowded as closely under it as he could,<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
to make it serve as a bulwark&mdash;though, indeed,
he well knew the futility of such a protection
against the avalanche that was now
crashing down the slope. Crouched there beneath
the log, Jim awaited the issue with an
unuttered prayer for escape in his heart&mdash;if
escape should be possible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:346px">
 <a href="images/p176f.jpg">
 <img border="0" src="images/p176t.jpg" width="346" height="226" alt="p176t" title="" />
 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">CROUCHED THERE BENEATH THE LOG, JIM AWAITED THE ISSUE.</p>

<p>In another instant the din of the snow-slide
burst on his ears in its full fury. And, along
with that thunderous noise, the daylight was
blotted out. In the darkness, the man felt the
soft, yet inexorable weight of the massed snow
crushing upon him, holding him as in a vise.
There was a tiny free space still beneath the
log, and as yet he had no lack of air. But
he was powerless to stir. He realized that
there was no possibility of digging his way
out through the heaped bulk of snow within
which he lay entombed. He could find no
room for hope. He resigned himself to meet
the end with what fortitude he might. A
wave of wrath swept through him that he
must die thus futilely, with his vengeance unaccomplished.
The emotion passed presently,<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
and in its stead came a vast and poignant
yearning for the woman he loved. By a
fierce effort of will, he fought down such desires,
which he deemed weakness at this time,
and strove to look Death in the face calmly,
with resignation and without fear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Jack Reeves and his bride, despite the excellence
of the young prospector's dog-team,
lagged behind the others in the long line of
the stampede, for the young husband had his
own ideas concerning a location likely to yield
the best results, and meant to let the crowd
precede him, in order that he might pursue
his course unmarked. So it came about that,
after the straggling procession of gold-hunters
had passed from the sight of Jim Maxwell,
the newly married pair entered the valley,
riding at ease behind the leisurely moving
dogs. Jim Maxwell, from his position on the
mountainside, held his gaze turned toward
where the last of the stampeders had vanished,
and so failed to observe the newcomers.
Thus, when the avalanche swept down upon<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
him, he had no thought that his wild, instinctive
cry for succor could be heard.</p>

<p>But it was. A quarter of a mile away,
Jack Reeves heard the despairful shout; and
Nell, too, heard it. Jack's quick gaze, darting
in the direction of the sound, caught a
glimpse of moving shadow against the white
surface of the slope, as Jim dropped from the
log to take shelter beneath it. At the same
time, there came to Jack's ears the first noise
of the avalanche's descent, and he understood
fully how great was the peril of the unknown,
whose cry for help he had heard. He called
to his dogs savagely, and sent them forward
toward the slope at speed. Before he had
time to explain to the startled Nell, the rush
and roar of the snow-slide made clear the situation
to her, familiar as she was with this peril
of the mountains. Yet, ere the hurtling
masses of snow buried the spot where he had
seen the moving shadow, Jack marked its location
precisely by means of an outcropping
ledge, just to the right of the tree-trunk. As
he went forward swiftly, he noted with relief<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
that the slide, which soon ceased, was a
comparatively small one, though of a size sufficient
to prove fatal to its victim, unless aided
from without.</p>

<p>At the foot of the slope, some distance to the
right of the freshly heaped-up snow, the sled
was halted. Jack and Nell put on their snow-shoes,
and, with a couple of spades from the
pack, made their way with some difficulty to
the jutting point of the ledge, which still protruded
a little beyond the new covering of
snow. A few feet to the left of this, they began
to dig, working with feverish haste.
They progressed rapidly, for the prospector
was in the full prime of his manhood, with
muscles like steel, and the girl, if less strong,
was in equally perfect condition, and with
training enough in the arduous life of the
frontier to make the toil simple to her.</p>

<p>They had dug down perhaps a score of feet,
and had reached, as Jack judged, almost to
the ground, so that he feared lest he might
have mistaken the location, when suddenly
Nell rested motionless.<span class="pagenum">[174]</span></p>

<p>"Listen!" she commanded. Her tense face
was radiant.</p>

<p>Jack ceased shoveling, and listened as he
had been bidden.</p>

<p>There came a faint, strangely muffled sound.
It came again&mdash;an indistinguishable, inarticulate
mutter from somewhere under the snow
at their feet.</p>

<p>Jack shouted triumphantly.</p>

<p>"By cricky, Nell," he cried joyously, "we've
struck him, sure as sin!" He raised his voice
to its full volume in a cheerful bellow, meant
to reach the ears of the imprisoned man
below:</p>

<p>"Buck up, old pal! We'll have you out in
a jiffy." Then the bridal pair betook themselves
to shoveling with the enthusiasm inspired
by success.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in the completion
of the work of rescue. Very soon, the excavation
reached the log under which Jim Maxwell
was sheltered, and he was able to crawl
forth with some difficulty, owing to cramped
and aching muscles, but safe and sound. He<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
was a little dazed over his escape, when he
had resigned himself to hopelessness. It
seemed to him as if a miracle had been
wrought in his behalf by the timely appearance
of these two, where he had believed there
was none to aid him. His feeling of wonder
was increased by the fact that one of these two
who had saved him from death, and who now
stood beside him supporting him, was a girl,
whose dark, lovely face beneath the fur cap
was alight with an almost maternal joy over
the deliverance in which she had shared.
The event seemed, somehow, to soften in a
certain degree the nature of the man, embittered
by long years of suffering under a grievous
wrong. For almost the first time since
the loss he had sustained at the hands of Dan
McGrew, Jim Maxwell felt a warm emotion,
which was close to tenderness. He continued
to regard the two bewilderedly. But his
voice, when at last he spoke, was firm, and
vibrant with gratitude:</p>

<p>"You saved me&mdash;and I sha'n't forget it."
He paused for a moment, then added whimsically:<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
"I don't know who you are, or how
you got here&mdash;unless you're two sure-enough
angels, dropped plumb-straight down from
heaven for this special occasion." The half-jesting
note left his voice. "And I'll say just
one thing: If you children ever need a
friend, you can call on me, and I sha'n't fail
you. In the meantime," he added briskly,
"I want you to be my guests for the night.
My cabin is near by&mdash;a little way up the gulch
there."</p>

<p>Something in the dignity of his manner as
he made the proffer of hospitality, some refinement
of inflection in his tones, caused the
listeners to look with new curiosity on this
roughly dressed man, whose face was almost
hidden beneath the thicket of beard. They
were moved by a sudden, compelling respect
for this uncouth-appearing dweller in the
waste. It needed but a glance between husband
and wife to ensure their acceptance of
the invitation. So, presently, the three rode
on together. They felt a certain unusual
kindliness in their relation as host and guests.<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
They attributed it, as far as they thought of
the matter at all, to the peculiar manner of
their meeting.... They could not guess that
strands woven by the Fates had caught them
in a mesh for the final right weaving of a
perfect design.<span class="pagenum">[178]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p>After the horses had been given up
and sent back, Lou, by Dan's arrangement,
continued the journey on the sled of
some men who were not properly of the stampeders,
but were bound for Malamute. Dan
himself, hardy as he was, had no difficulty in
keeping up the pace with the best of the travelers
on foot. He carried snow-shoes&mdash;for
which he had no present need as the crust held&mdash;and
a light pack on his back. The others
of the stampeders regarded him as one of
themselves, without ulterior purpose beyond
the legitimate finding of gold somewhere in
the creek-beds, or within the ledges of the
mountains. Only Lou guessed aught of the
evil project cherished by her husband. She
had little compunction, for her sensibilities
had become hardened with the passage of the
years, and she had long ceased to regard herself<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
as in any wise the keeper of Dan's conscience.</p>

<p>Dan himself, as always, had no scruples,
though he meant to add yet another to the list
of his crimes. He went warily to his work.
He held Sam Ward under close observation,
but so discreetly that the victim of his watchfulness
had no hint of it. As the train straggled
out toward nightfall, Dan contrived to be
near his intended victim, though not in company
with him. Because of the information
gathered by Lou, that the miner meant to steal
away from the others during the night, Dangerous
Dan had determined to keep a vigil
during the hours of darkness, so that, when the
miner slipped away by stealth, thinking himself
unobserved by any one, he would be able
to follow as stealthily, and thus to trace the
owner to the secret mine.</p>

<p>To one of Dangerous Dan McGrew's accomplishments
the task was very simple.
The night was clear, and he became aware at
once when Sam Ward prepared to set forth.
He allowed the miner to proceed for a considerable<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
distance before following. Against
the white surface of the snow, the moving
form was distinguishable for a long way, and,
since it alone in the expanse moved at all, it
was not to be mistaken. But, while the miner
was so distinctly visible to his pursuer, Dan
McGrew had little fear of being himself observed,
since no eyes were seeking his presence
there. So, separated by a considerable distance,
the two men advanced through the
night, ascending at a smart pace from the level
reaches of the valley to the lower slopes of the
mountains. Here the spruce cast black
shade, and often gorges lay deep in shadow.
Dan was forced to lessen the distance between
himself and the one he followed. Often, he
was hard put to it to keep close enough on his
quarry to be sure of the man's movements,
without revealing his own presence on the
trail. Some risks he took, since needs must.
But the danger of discovery did not trouble
Dangerous Dan, for he had never lacked
courage, whatever his other vices.</p>

<p>It was in the gray of the dawn when at last<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
Sam Ward halted, with a grunt of satisfaction,
which the listening man, crouched behind
a stump fifty yards away, plainly heard
through the motionless chill air. The miner
cast off the pack that he had carried throughout
most of the day and all of the night, and
began hasty preparations for pitching camp....
It was evident that Sam Ward had
reached his destination.</p>

<p>Assured that this was the end of the journey,
Dangerous Dan silently withdrew to a
sheltered nook within the trees, a full quarter
of a mile from the other's camp. Here he
built a fire, without any fear of its light being
seen by Sam Ward; for, besides the screen of
trees, a high ridge intervened between the two
camps. Dan, owing to the unusual mildness
of the night, did not trouble with piling green
logs against which to stack his fire, but contented
himself with selecting a spot where a
steep bank at his back aided in the retention of
the heat.</p>

<p>Tired as he was, Dangerous Dan gathered
sufficient fuel ready at hand, so that he might<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
replenish the blaze, arousing instinctively
from sleep as the flames died down. He
guessed that the miner would sleep late, after
the fatigue of the trip. But he allowed himself
only two hours of rest; for he had yet
much to do, and weariness must await leisure.
Dan McGrew could sacrifice selfish desires
for the time being in order to attain to selfish
ends.</p>

<p>The sun was well above the horizon, when
Dan McGrew at last arose reluctantly, and
stamped out the dying embers. He rolled up
his pack, but left it where he had camped.
He carried a revolver with him, but he had no
intention of using it, lest the report attract
the attention of some chance prospector in the
vicinity. He was not quite sure, even, that he
meditated violence&mdash;it might not be necessary.
But, before setting forth, he drew from its
sheath, hidden within his bosom, a long,
wicked-looking knife, the blade of which he
examined approvingly, testing its edge with a
bare thumb. When he had returned the
weapon to its place of concealment, he went<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
forward very cautiously, his feet leaving
hardly a trace of their passage over the snow-crust.
He took advantage of the shelter afforded
by bushes and trees, so that his approach
might not be detected. Thus, he came
finally to a vantage point behind a clump of
bushes, which grew on a little knoll. Below
this, hardly a score of yards away, was Sam
Ward's camp.</p>

<p>The miner was just arousing from sleep,
when Dan reached this point of observation.
While the hidden man watched attentively,
Sam Ward replenished the fire, and hastily
prepared a breakfast, which he devoured even
more hastily. Forthwith, then, he set about
the serious business of the day. To the
watcher's surprise, the miner removed a heap
of firewood, which had been stacked against
the sloping bank, some distance above a tiny
frozen stream. When the branches had been
thrown aside, there was revealed an opening
through the snow, and on into the earth itself.
It was evident that the miner had already tunneled
into the ledge.<span class="pagenum">[184]</span></p>

<p>Now, he got dynamite from his pack, and
set it carefully where it might thaw out within
the radius of heat from the fire. Thereafter,
he crawled into the tunnel, and was occupied
out of the watcher's sight for some time. On
emergence, he examined the dynamite, and,
satisfied with its condition, took it, along with
caps and fuse, on his return into the tunnel.
This time, he was gone for only a short interval.
Presently, came a dull rumble as the explosive
detonated within the earth. The
miner re&euml;ntered the tunnel, carrying a bag.
When he brought this forth, he was staggering
under the weight it contained.</p>

 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">DAN McGREW, STARING DOWN WITH HUNGRY EYES, SAW THE MINER.</p>

<p>Dan McGrew, staring down with hungry
eyes, saw the miner pound the fragments of
rock to powder in a roughly contrived mortar,
which was set beside the fire. Dangerous
Dan had learned enough of gold-mining to
understand that the miner had chanced on a
quartz lead of the richest sort. Undoubtedly,
it was a vein of considerable size which would
assay thousands of dollars to the ton. It was
free-milling ore. The rough method employed<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
by the miner was sufficient to secure the
golden treasure. Now, when he had made an
end of crushing the bits of rock, Sam descended
to the creek, where he chopped a hole
through the ice, and so, after great labor, was
able to winnow the dust. Dan McGrew was
able to see the golden stream of tiny flakes that
the miner at last poured into his poke, with
chuckles of glee. The watcher's steady eyes
narrowed and grew savage, for black envy
and avarice filled his heart. Of a sudden, his
vague purpose became crystallized.... He
would have this mine for his own&mdash;at any cost.</p>

<p>Dangerous Dan looked over the scene carefully,
as he made his plans. The little stream,
above which the miner had encamped, ran
straight between shallow banks out into a
broad valley beyond. Dan was sure that he
could advance to a point on the slope where he
would be just above his unsuspecting prey.
Thence, he could drop down on the miner,
who, all unconscious of any peril, squatted before
the fire gloating over his treasure. A
single blow of the knife would put a term to<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
his ownership of the mine. Afterward, it
would be a simple matter to conceal the body
in some cranny where only the wolves would
be likely to scent it out. And Dan McGrew
would have the treasure-house for his own.</p>

<p>His decision made, Dan acted upon it at
once. It came about according to his calculations&mdash;with
two exceptions:</p>

<p>The first was that, as he leaped upon his victim
from behind, some faintest sound of movement,
or some subtle instinct in the victim,
gave warning. Sam Ward sprang to his feet,
whirling as he rose. The lust of gold was in
him, too. On the instant, he understood the
death that threatened and the cause of it. He
fought for his life and his gold with all the
strength that was in him. He got his hands
to his assailant's throat, and the fingers
clutched in a clutch meant to kill. Dangerous
Dan's eyes goggled from his head as he
strangled within that grip. But he did not
forget, even in his anguish, either his purpose
or his advantage. He thrust the knife with
all his power into the miner's breast. For a<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
second that seemed to endure for an eternity,
Dan was still held in the vice-like grasp.
Then abruptly, there came a gurgling moan
from Sam Ward's lips. The clenched fingers
relaxed. Dan thrust the form of his adversary
from him. The haft of the knife, which he
still held in his right hand, was broken from
the blade by the wrench of the inert body, as
it fell and went limply sliding down the slope
toward the creek.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:349px">

 <img border="0" src="images/p202t.jpg" width="349" height="227" alt="p202t" title="" />
 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">HE FOUGHT FOR HIS LIFE AND HIS GOLD WITH ALL THE STRENGTH THAT WAS IN HIM.</p>

<p>Dan McGrew gazed on the grim descent
with eyes that were dull still from the deadly
grapple. His breath came in sobs. He was
triumphant, but he realized how close he had
been to failure.</p>

<p>Then, a minute later, when his brain and
his sight were clear again, he suddenly uttered
a frightful curse....</p>

<p>In the wide expanse of the valley into which
the creek flowed, a sled moved rapidly, as the
dogs strained in their harness. And it was
coming straight toward the creek&mdash;toward the
place where he stood. Dangerous Dan
McGrew cursed yet once again&mdash;and more<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
horribly. Then, he leaped down the slope to
where the dead body had halted. He stooped
over it&mdash;searched with desperate rapidity. A
moment later, with the poke of gold and a few
papers from the dead man, Dangerous Dan
raced back up the bank, and on, flying from the
spot where he had committed a crime so great
for a reward so small.<span class="pagenum">[189]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p>The bridal pair were at once astonished
and gratified by the entertainment offered
them in this remote wilderness. There
was nothing remarkable in their surroundings
at the cabin. The fare provided was of the
simplest. The effect on the two visitors was
produced wholly by the personality of the
man himself. As the men sat in easy communion
over their pipes, while Nell listened
eagerly, Jim Maxwell, still under the influence
of that softer feeling aroused by gratitude
to the two who had rescued him, relaxed from
the usual aloofness toward his fellows, and
talked of many things in a manner of singular
charm. Jack Reeves had had excellent advantages
in education, before ever the spirit of
adventure drove him toward the Arctic. As
he perceived the extent of the older man's experience,<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
he plied his host with questions.
To these, Jim responded readily&mdash;at first from
courtesy, and then, moved by patent interest
on the part of his hearers, with a certain enthusiasm.
He found a long-forgotten pleasure
in thus speaking at ease of the things he
felt to sympathetic auditors. In the years of
his wandering and suffering, the man's nature
had deepened and mellowed, even though it
was shut within the crust of bitterness. So, to-night,
he gave himself unreservedly to this
new mood of genial intercourse. He marveled
over his own changed mood, but indulged
it to the full, nevertheless. In a gentle,
unfamiliar fashion, Jim Maxwell was
almost happy to-night&mdash;almost happy, for the
first time in twelve years.</p>

<p>Nell's presence moved him deeply, though
she sat silent for the most part. Her close attention
was a compliment greater than any
words she could have uttered. Jim Maxwell
felt this, and yielded to the inspiration of it.
He was by no means unaware of the piquant
loveliness of the girl. His critical appreciation<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
was betrayed by many swift, penetrating
glances at the rapt face. The dusk, lucent
beauty of her eyes especially appealed to him.
In them, he glimpsed her soul, full of the joy
of life, a-thrill with expectation of the happiness
that awaited, pure and undaunted by any
fear of evil. As he looked on her, Jim's admiring
gaze was always a little wistful. Since
the tragedy in his life, women had had no interest
for him, because he had lost her whom
he loved. To-night, somehow, it was different.
He felt himself strangely drawn to
this unknown girl. His heart stirred toward
her. It was not an emotion of which even a
bridegroom could complain&mdash;it was something
utterly untouched by any instinct of sex, something
subtle and exquisite. Jim himself could
not understand his feeling in the least. Only,
he yielded to the spell of it with delight.</p>

<p>The host left his guests in possession, when
it came the hour for retiring. He was deaf to
their remonstrances, and betook himself to an
outbuilding, which had been his first shelter
in this place, before the making of the cabin.<span class="pagenum">[192]</span></p>

<p>Left alone with her husband, Nell spoke
musingly, very softly:</p>

<p>"What a wonderful man, Jack! He is the
sort of man I should like&mdash;" She broke off,
staring with vaguely puzzled, unseeing eyes at
the glowing stove.</p>

<p>"Now, what do you mean by that?" the
bridegroom demanded, with asperity.</p>

<p>Nell aroused from introspection at the
shortness of the husband's tone. Then she
laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd, goosie!" she bantered.
"I actually believe you'd like to be jealous of
the first man I've met on our honeymoon."
Her voice softened. "Well, you needn't be.
But he is a dear, all the same."</p>

<p>Something in her tone quelled the young
husband's impulse of alarm. Straightway, he
spoke his own admiration, without further
jealousy.</p>

<p>"He sure is a wonder," he declared emphatically.
"He's one of the sort who could make
himself at home&mdash;and make himself the
center of attraction, too&mdash;anywhere around
the world, with high or low or Jack or the
game."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[193]</span></p>

<p>A little later, he spoke again, reflectively:</p>

<p>"I wonder what he did!"</p>

<p>"What he did!" Nell repeated, bewildered.</p>

<p>"Whether he robbed a bank, or just murdered
somebody," Jack explained.</p>

<p>Nell flared.</p>

<p>"He's not that sort!" she flung at him.
Then, her eyes grew dreamy again.</p>

<p>"But," she added&mdash;and there was a note of
sympathetic tenderness in her voice&mdash;"perhaps
it was something that somebody else did."</p>

<p>"Eh?" Jack demanded, perplexed in his
turn.</p>

<p>"I mean," Nell said, half-apologetically,
"perhaps it was something&mdash;some crime even&mdash;some
one else did that made Mr. Maxwell
come away off here, to live alone in the mountains.
A man like him!"</p>

<p>Next morning, Jack and Nell went on their
way, almost regretfully, so great was the impression
made upon both by this man whom
they had rescued from death. Still without<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
haste, Jack drove his dogs over the level valley-crust.
As it drew toward night, he selected
for his camp a point where a few
stunted spruce grew a little way up the slope.</p>

<p>"I guess we're alone in our glory," he commented,
as his eyes swept the scene. "Not a
stampeder in sight&mdash;and I'm glad of it. You
see," he continued, as Nell looked at him inquiringly,
"I've been over this way before.
There's a creek flows in here from the other
side of the valley. I was up it once. It
showed some prospects. I'd like another look
at it&mdash;without any stampeders by. And
there's not a one in sight."</p>

<p>"I wonder!" While Jack went to
straighten out the over-lively dogs, Nell took
the field-glasses from their case, and amused
herself with a careful scrutiny of this white
world over which now lay a purpling glamour
as the sun sank wearily below the horizon.</p>

<p>Suddenly, there was a moving blur, a fleeting
black shadow, in the line of vision.
Hitherto, there had been no sign of life anywhere.
This trace of activity, in the stillness<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
of the snow-clad wild, interested her, even
startled her a little, though she had no thought
that it could be more than a glimpse of some
stampeder plodding through the distance.</p>

<p>Nell adjusted the glasses, and sought again.
Then, in a flash, she saw clearly&mdash;a camp-fire
burning, a man squatted close to the flames.
There was nothing out of the ordinary in the
scene. It was not the sight of camp-fire and
man beside it that caused Nell's cheek to pale,
that caused her hand to shake, until for a
moment the vision was blurred, that caused the
little gasp from her lips. It was another figure
thus revealed there in the far distance that
so affected her&mdash;another figure high up on the
slope, which moved with a craftiness and
stealth that were in themselves sinister. These
were the slinking movements of a beast of prey.
But the figure was that of a man.</p>

<p>Nell called to Jack&mdash;softly, as if she feared
lest, across the valley-space, that skulking man
might hear her cry.</p>

<p>When Jack came to her, Nell put the glasses
in his hands.<span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>"Look there!" she directed, and pointed.
Afterward, she sat tensed and apprehensive in
her place on the sled, while her husband stood
at her side, and looked as she had bidden him.</p>

<p>An ejaculation burst from Jack as his eyes
caught the action in that drama across the valley.
Through a long minute, and another,
he rested rigid, silent. Suddenly, with an
imprecation, he tossed the glasses toward Nell.
He pointed desperately across the valley, then
sprang to the dogs, and straightened them out,
his voice so harsh that they cringed under it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:358px">
 <a href="images/p203f.jpg">
 <img border="0" src="images/p203t.jpg" width="358" height="234" alt="p203t" title="" />
 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">HE POINTED DESPERATELY ACROSS THE VALLEY.</p>

<p>"Mush!" he yelled savagely, and the whiplash
hissed its message to the leaders.... They
were off at full speed.</p>

<p>"Too late!" Jack groaned, as the dogs
bounded forward. "Oh, damn him! I hope
he hangs for it&mdash;the dirty murderer!"</p>

<p>It was, indeed, too late. When they were
come up the lesser valley, through which the
creek ran, to a point near where the body of
Sam Ward was lying, Jack halted the dogs,
and went forward alone. He would not
yield to Nell's pleadings that she be allowed<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
to accompany him. He was not minded that
she should thus look on the assassin's victim.</p>

<p>Jack returned very soon.</p>

<p>"Dead as a door-nail!" he said shortly. His
face was a little pale under the bronze of
open-air living. "A knife-blade in his chest&mdash;handle
broken off. We've seen the chap.
It was Sam Ward. Had a secret mine, they
said."</p>

<p>Jack chose a camp-site close at hand, to
which he removed the body of the murdered
man, so that it would be protected from any
prowling wolf. He brought down to his
camp the dead man's pack, and he covered the
still and rigid shape decently with one of the
blankets that had been Sam Ward's. He
made no attempt to trace the assassin. To
have done so would have been useless in itself,
and would have been to risk the like
death. Nor did he make even a cursory
search for the secret mine. He had no wish
for personal profit out of this grewsome event.
On the contrary, he was willing to delay his
operations in the mountains, in order that he<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
might deliver the corpse to the authorities, and
make known to them the facts in the case.</p>

<p>"We'll put him on the sled in the morning,"
he said to Nell, who was very quiet, and who
turned her eyes from time to time fearfully
toward a place just on the edge of the firelight,
where flickering shadows danced grotesquely
over a deeper shadow&mdash;a shadow
huge and misshapen and menacing.</p>

<p>"We'll take him up to Kalmak. It's a little
place on the way to Malamute. But they
have a sheriff, and that's what we need."</p>

<p>And neither he nor his wife, who looked
from time to time affrightedly toward the
shadows, had any hint as to the irony that the
Fates had put into the husband's concluding
words.<span class="pagenum">[199]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p>Dan McGrew, from a point of safe
concealment, watched the coming of
the sled with keen interest. He was still furious
over the miscarriage in his plans caused
by this arrival. There was no longer possibility
of his holding the secret of the mine for
himself. In return for the blood on his hands,
he had gained a single poke of gold-dust.
His chief concern now was the evading of
any possible suspicion against himself. His
thoughts were busy with this problem of
safety. At his distance, and in the darkening
light, he could not make out the identity of
the man who examined the body of Sam Ward,
and afterward removed it. Since Nell did
not leave the sled, he did not guess even that
one of the two was a woman. But it did occur
to him that, since the arrival of these persons
had thwarted his evil hopes, it would be<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
fitting that they themselves should serve his
need as the scape-goats of suspicion.</p>

<p>Once this idea had stirred in his brain, Dangerous
Dan found little difficulty in planning
the accomplishment of his designs. He remained
in hiding, without venturing even to
light a fire though he was hard put to it to
resist the numbing cold. It was not till some
hours after nightfall, when he judged the two
in their camp safely asleep, that Dangerous
Dan acted on the plan he had formed.</p>

<p>He crept with the utmost caution down the
slope, and made a wide d&eacute;tour, so as to come
near the camp to windward of the point where
he heard the little yelps and whinings of dogs
restless in their sleep. The night was clear,
and, even within the shadows of the trees
about the camp, Dan could see distinctly
where the sled stood outside the limit of the
firelight. Toward this, with increased care
and slowness in the progress, Dan made his
way.</p>

<p>He had almost reached the sled, when he
stumbled over what he had deemed merely a<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
deeper shadow beside it, and sprawled forward.
To save himself from falling, he
thrust out his right hand. The palm touched
something cold&mdash;with a coldness beyond that
of the arctic air. It was the face of the man
whom he had slain, from off which his rough
contact had thrust the blanket. And Dan
McGrew knew the thing for what it was.</p>

<p>Strong man that he was, he was sickened.
For a little, he stood there shivering, unnerved
by the grisly encounter. But it was only the
shock that had unmanned him. Presently,
his courage rose again. He grinned to himself,
standing there in the dark over the dead
body. Here was nothing to be afraid of, he
said to himself in brutal disdain of his own
weakness. So, soon, he went on again, quite
undismayed, to carry out his purpose.</p>

<p>Noiselessly, Dangerous Dan fumbled over
the pack on the sled for some minutes. Once,
he put a hand in his pocket, and drew forth
something, which he disposed within the
wrappings of the pack. Finally, he readjusted
everything, as nearly as he could by the<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
sense of touch, to the condition in which he
had found it. Only, there was something
added to the contents. For once in his life,
Dangerous Dan had not been a robber. Yet,
never had his intent been more deadly.</p>

<p>His task thus accomplished, the man withdrew
as silently as he had come. Nevertheless,
despite his bravado, he was at pains to
tread aside, lest he brush a second time against
that blanketed form.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Jack and Nell were up and away early.
They made good speed with the grewsome
burden on the sled. They ran easily without
snow-shoes, for the crust still held. Jack
was distressed that his bride should be unable
to ride luxuriously on their honeymoon.
But for this Nell cared not at all. In her
youth and perfect health, the physical activity
was, in truth, a pleasure, rather than a
toil. But she was disturbed by the presence
of that grim thing which they escorted. She
could not avoid yielding in some measure to
superstition. The radiant joy of her bridal<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
was quenched by this tragedy that had followed
so close upon it, and into association
with which they had been forced by circumstance.
Her mood was oppressed with forebodings.
She was all anxiety to reach Kalmak,
where they might be rid of this ill-omened
clay. So, she urged Jack often to increase the
pace. And he, for his part, hardly less sensitive
to this malignant influence at such a time,
consented readily enough, hurrying on the
dogs with whip and voice.... The train
swung into Kalmak in mid-afternoon&mdash;at least
an hour sooner than it would have made the
distance with a lighter load.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:358px">
 <a href="images/p220f.jpg">
 <img border="0" src="images/p220t.jpg" width="358" height="233" alt="p220t" title="" />
 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">SHE WAS DISTURBED BY THE PRESENCE OF THAT GRIM THING WHICH THEY ESCORTED.</p>

<p>Jack halted the dogs before the very unpretentious
structure that was inappropriately
designated the Grand Hotel. At sound of the
arrival, those within hurried forth, eager for
any interruption of the day's monotony.
Among the others came a tall, lank man, with
a lantern-jawed face and a drooping, melancholy
mustache, whom Jack recognized as Hal
Owens, the sheriff. He himself, however,
was not known to Owens, or to any of those<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
present, nor was Nell, as they were speedily
to learn to their sorrow. Another face in the
group was vaguely familiar to both the young
husband and his bride. Jack, for the moment,
could not recall where he had seen this
stalwart, handsome man, who stood with a
masterful erectness, emphasized by his frank
and fearless gaze. But Nell, in the instant of
seeing the stranger, recollected him perfectly,
though she had seen him but once in a fleeting
glance. She remembered how he had appeared
on her wedding-day, and how he had
regarded her with that cynical smile, which
had aroused in her an inexplicable sense of
dismay, a fear of mysterious disasters, past
or to come. It seemed to her appropriate
enough that now this man should be present to
welcome her and her husband as they brought
in their ghastly load. Again, she experienced
a curious repugnance in meeting the steady
stare that seemed to probe into her soul with
a mocking amusement. Nell wrenched her
eyes from his, and turned away with a little
shudder of revulsion. Then, the natural<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
buoyancy of her spirits asserted itself. After
all, this man, who affected her so strangely,
was nothing to them&mdash;could be nothing to
them. And they were at last free of the horrible
incubus that had been thrust upon them.
The dead body was now gone out of their
charge, was become the property of the law.
She smiled, a little wanly, while her eyes
moved over the roughly garbed cluster of men.
She was glad&mdash;oh, so glad!&mdash;that miserable interruption
of their honeymoon was done and
over.</p>

<p>Jack addressed the sheriff briskly, himself
almost as anxious as Nell to have done with
this wretched matter.</p>

<p>"This is your business, Sheriff. I've
brought in the body of a chap who got killed
out Forgotten Creek way, yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>The sheriff nodded with what he took to be
the dignity befitting his authority.</p>

<p>"The coroner should set on the corpse," he
said gravely, pleased at this display of his familiarity
with legal phrases. "In his absence&mdash;bein'<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
there hain't none&mdash;I reckon I'll do the
best I kin."</p>

<p>He strode to the sled, and pulled aside the
blanket that had concealed the dead man's
face. He turned to the men who had crowded
around.</p>

<p>"Anybody know him?" he demanded, authoritatively.</p>

<p>There was a chorus of grunts in negation.</p>

<p>Then, as the others fell silent, Jack spoke
again:</p>

<p>"I knew him by sight, though I never spoke
to him. His name was Sam Ward. They
said he'd struck it rich&mdash;a secret mine somewhere
in the mountains."</p>

<p>"Know anything more about him?" The
sheriff's voice was heavy with responsibility.</p>

<p>Jack made an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>"He was in the stampede that came up to
Forgotten Creek day before yesterday. You
know?"</p>

<p>"I know," the sheriff assented. "What else
do you know?"</p>

<p>"I know he's dead," Jack snapped. He was<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
heartily sick of this business, and his temper
grew strained. "If you have any doubt about
it," he added sarcastically, "why, I saw him
killed."</p>

<p>There was a general start of surprise over
this bald announcement. The sheriff, however,
preserved his official composure.</p>

<p>"That ought to help some," was his response.
"Supposin' now, you fire ahead, an' tell all
you know about this corpse o' your'n."</p>

<p>"No corpse of mine!" Jack retorted gruffly,
more than ever annoyed, while Nell felt a
qualm of new dread at the sheriff's ambiguous
words. But Jack curbed his impatience, and
related in detail what he knew concerning the
incidents of the tragedy.</p>

<p>His hearers listened intently. There were
features in this murder that gave it a certain
distinction. The fact that it had been witnessed
from such a distance through the field-glasses
gave it a charm of novelty that a mere
murder must otherwise have lacked. The
men, who had hitherto been stealing many a
sly glance toward the young woman with the<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
dainty face and glowing eyes, now stared at
her with open admiration for the one who had
first seen the assassin's advance upon his victim,
and had guessed his deadly purpose. All
those present accepted the truth of the narrative
without question. The young man's
frank expression and the simplicity of his
story, strange as it was, carried conviction.
Moreover, it was well-nigh impossible to suspect
this beautiful girl of any complicity in
crime. So, the account was accepted by all
hearers as truth, and it occurred to none even
to question it.... To none, save one. And
that one was he who, of his own knowledge,
best knew that it was truth. Yet, he would
question, and to some purpose&mdash;for his own
safety's sake.</p>

<p>The formalities of the occasion thus fully
satisfied, the sheriff ordered the corpse removed
to a back room in the hotel, where it
was laid out on the table. Before replacing
the blanket, the sheriff withdrew the blade of
the knife from the dead man's breast.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:358px">

 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">THE FORMALITIES FULLY SATISFIED, THE SHERIFF ORDERED THE CORPSE REMOVED.</p>

<p>"It's a clew," he explained, with obvious
admiration for his own sagacity, as he wiped
the blackened blood from the blade upon the
blanket.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[209]</span></p>

<p>Dan McGrew had followed the four men
who, at the sheriff's direction, carried the body
into the hotel. He was known here, as
through most of the region round about,
where he was regarded as an honest gambler&mdash;for
his methods had improved in the
twelve years since his discomfiture by Fingie
Whalen.</p>

<p>To be here at this time, Dangerous Dan
McGrew had employed the resources of both
mind and body. His reasoning had convinced
him that Kalmak would be Jack's destination
in the trip. He had been obliged to
risk the correctness of this conclusion in order
that he might be free to start for the village
at once, after completing his night-visit to the
young man's camp. Since he must travel on
foot, and slowly because of increasing fatigue,
he had need of all the time he could gain for
the journey, in order to reach the scene first.
He had succeeded. Even, he had had time<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
for an hour's sleep, which was craved by every
atom in his body after a day and two nights
of almost constant exertion.</p>

<p>So, now, Dan McGrew was on the spot,
alert and arrogant with evil purpose. He
stepped close to the sheriff, and spoke so that
the others could not overhear. He knew the
harmless vanity of the official, and meant to
play upon it for his own ends, by letting the
other take credit on himself for great shrewdness.</p>

<p>"You think that youngster's story is a bit
fishy, I see!" Dan remarked; and there was
deep admiration in his voice.</p>

<p>The sheriff, who had thought nothing of the
sort, immediately assumed an air of suspicion,
and nodded assent.</p>

<p>"Fishy&mdash;very!" he agreed.</p>

<p>"Of course," Dan continued deprecatingly,
as if even to question this were an impertinence
on his part, "you'll search that young
man's pack?"</p>

<p>The sheriff nodded glumly.</p>

<p>"It's my sworn duty to do jest that."<span class="pagenum">[211]</span></p>

<p>Dan sauntered away, well content. He
went out of the hotel, and stood unobtrusively
among the other idlers, watching while Jack
and Nell, restored to the best of spirits by the
completion of their unpleasant duty, were now
laughing and chatting together as they busied
themselves about the sled.</p>

<p>Presently appeared the sheriff. He approached
the sled, and spoke with a harshness
he had not hitherto displayed.</p>

<p>"Young feller, I'll jest take a look through
your pack."</p>

<p>Jack and Nell glanced up in amazement at
the tone no less than at the words.</p>

<p>"But what&mdash;what the devil do you mean?"
Jack demanded, wrathfully.</p>

<p>"Never you mind what I mean, young feller,"
was the offended retort. The sheriff
threw back the lapel of the heavy outer coat
he wore, and showed a silver shield. "There's
my authority," he sternly announced. "I'll
jest take a squint through your belongin's."</p>

<p>Jack and Nell protested, but their protests
were in vain. The sheriff in explanation<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
vouchsafed only a single word, most contemptuously
uttered:</p>

<p>"Fishy!"</p>

<p>In the end, the young pair stood by in mute
indignation, while the official search was
prosecuted.... They had one consolation in
the presence of this outrage: The search
would prove its own absurdity.</p>

<p>The issue came on them like a thunderbolt.
From somewhere in the pack, the sheriff's
groping fingers drew forth an object, which he
held up that all might see. It was undoubtedly
the bone handle of a large knife. Without
a word, the sheriff reached into a pocket
of his coat, and brought forth the blade which
had been in the dead man's breast. Still without
a word, while all looked on in breathless
tension, he put blade and haft together. They
fitted perfectly.</p>

<p>The sheriff's mouth, under the drooping
mustache, twisted in a triumphant grin. An
amazed consternation held Jack and Nell silent
for the moment in the face of this damning
evidence against them. The sheriff<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
moved forward a step, and laid his hand on
Jack's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Young feller," he said heavily, "I arrest
you in the name of the law, for the murder
of Sam Ward, deceased. And don't say anythin',"
he added, in paraphrase of the legal
formula, "for what you say will be used agin
ye."<span class="pagenum">[214]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p>The catastrophe that had thus put an end
to the honeymoon, drove the unfortunate
husband and wife almost to despair.
The thing was monstrous, incredible. Nevertheless,
it had occurred. Jack raged against
the unjust accusation which Dan McGrew
had caused to be laid against him; but neither
his wrath nor his entreaties were powerful
enough to create even a doubt on the part of
the public of Kalmak as to his guilt. The
evidence against him was, in fact, incontrovertible.
His case was made the worse, also,
by the absence of any one who could vouch for
his character. Given time, he could easily
enough summon witnesses in his behalf,
though even then the issue might be uncertain.
He had no plausible explanation to offer concerning
the presence of the knife-handle
among his effects. He could only deny all<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
knowledge of how it came there. And such
denial was utterly valueless, as Jack himself
realized with utter discouragement.</p>

<p>As for Nell, there was only a single thing
to mitigate her misery, and of this she was
hardly conscious. It was that she herself was
not subjected to the indignity of arrest. In
this matter, the chivalry of the community
worked in her behalf. These men of the
Northland were not of a sort to war against
women. They left such warfare to a more
complex state of civilization.</p>

<p>But, in truth, no arrest was needed for the
unhappy bride. Nothing could have tempted
her to leave the place where her husband was
in peril. Indeed, she was like a thorn in the
side of the sheriff's ideas concerning official
strictness and decorum&mdash;and rose as well as
thorn; for the winsome loveliness of this suffering
girl disturbed him greatly, so that he
was fain to grant her privileges which ill accorded
with his conception of official etiquette.
It was owing to this laxness under Nell's persuasion
that she was permitted to interview<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
her husband, though separated from him by
the heavy grating in the cell-door, and though
fretted by the presence of the sheriff himself,
who sat within ear-shot, and forbade secret
communication.... Those interviews harrowed
the souls of the lovers, for, though each
strove to cheer the other, neither could understand
how this calamity had come to pass.
Nell occupied the intervals between visits to
her husband in frantic efforts to devise some
means of proving Jack's innocence, or in pitiable
weeping, shut within her squalid hotel-room.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:220px">
 <a href="images/p230f.jpg">
 <img border="0" src="images/p230t.jpg" width="220" height="342" alt="p230t" title="" />
 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">NELL WAS PERMITTED TO INTERVIEW HER HUSBAND.</p>

<p>It was in the forenoon of the day following
his arrest that the prisoner had his first glimmer
of hope. It came to him while he was
surveying for the thousandth time the roughly-hewn
timbers that made the walls of his cell.
He had long ago admitted the uselessness of
trying to break out, inasmuch as he had not
even a penknife with which to work. Yet,
now, as his glance roved the tiny room, his
eyes lighted with hope.</p>

<p>Forthwith, Jack began plotting escape.
He understood that his situation was most desperate.
The sheriff, who from pride in his
office had added the cell to his log-house at
his own expense, was fond of sitting on guard
in the adjoining room; not so much for the
sake of precaution against the prisoner's escape,
as for pleasure in receiving visitors, in
the full majesty of his office. And Jack had
heard some of the low-spoken remarks of the
visitors among themselves. He knew that
these men of primitive emotions looked upon
him as a murderer, and were disposed to end
the affair in a lynching-bee. Only the sheriff
interposed between him and such a fate, and
the man was by no means strong enough to
stand against a mob. Therefore, Jack was
convinced that the only possibility of safety
lay in flight. And that flight must be made at
once, or it would be too late.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[217]</span></p>


<p>Little by little, the details of a plan were
evolved. He went over the matter with every
care, knowing well that he risked his life on
the accuracy of each detail in his device.
Some ideas he rejected; others, after much<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
testing and readjustment, were approved. In
the end, he became confident that his method
might win success&mdash;confident that it would.</p>

<p>His preparations thus complete up to the
point of action, the prisoner did not delay the
action itself. For that matter, the opportunity
he desired at the outset was offered to him
almost immediately after he had decided upon
his course.</p>

<p>The sheriff, who was a kindly soul, apart
from the sternness compelled by his ideas of
high office, repeated a favor he had already
shown the prisoner, by coming to the grating,
and thrusting forward a cigar.</p>

<p>"Smoke up, young feller," he said.</p>

<p>Jack took the cigar with due expressions
of gratitude, and he was at pains to conceal
the new hopeful eagerness that filled him.</p>

<p>"And here's the match, young feller," the
sheriff continued, as he held it forth. It was
one of the regulations formulated by himself
that the inmates of the jail should not be allowed
possession of matches.</p>

<p>Of that regulation, Jack was already aware,<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
and to secure its evasion, he now acted. As
the sheriff turned away, in pursuance of his
principle of not encouraging familiarity on
the part of a prisoner, Jack tossed the match
to the floor, where it lay invisible in the light
which shone in from the other room. Then
he addressed the sheriff, with becoming humility.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Sheriff, but the match went out."</p>

<p>Dan McGrew, in the sheriff's place, would
have demanded the return of that match. Instead,
the official turned back promptly, and
gave another, with which the prisoner succeeded
in lighting his cigar. The sheriff,
seated at his table, could not see the captive,
who stooped and picked up from the floor the
first match, and put it away in his pocket with
extraordinary care.</p>

<p>Thereafter, still careful to escape observation
by the sheriff, Jack got out a stub of pencil
which he had been allowed to retain. He
secured a small fragment of paper from the
untidy litter on the floor of the cell. Then,
he hastily scribbled a brief note. This was<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
rolled up into a tiny cylinder with the writing
on the inner side. By liberal moistening with
his tongue he managed to make the roll retain
its shape. Having accomplished all he could
for the time being, the prisoner, with the cylinder
in his pocket, awaited the coming of Nell.</p>

<p>The wife's advent was not long delayed.
Within the hour, the girl appeared before the
sheriff, softly appealing in voice, more softly
appealing in the gaze of her misty eyes. The
official strove to frown, but only succeeded in
smirking shamefacedly.</p>

<p>"I suppose it can't do any harm to let you
chin a little," he said grudgingly. "But remember
now," he added, shaking a warning
finger at the visitor, "no whispering, an' keep
your hands in plain sight all the time. An'
I'll have my eyes on you, you bet!"</p>

<p>With a murmur of thanks, Nell went forward
to the grating, where she stood with her
hands duly exposed against the metal bars.
Husband and wife exchanged greetings as
best they could, thus forced to speak aloud so
that the sheriff could hear every word. Yet,<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
without anything said to warrant it, Nell knew
instantly that her husband's mood had
changed. There was a light in his eyes, a
smile on his lips. And, too, he nodded almost
imperceptibly, very mysteriously. Nell felt
her own spirits rise in response. They spoke
of sending to Malamute for a lawyer. They
spoke of securing proof against the actual
murderer&mdash;at which the sheriff smiled.</p>

<p>But the sheriff, though he listened so intently,
did not watch with equal closeness.
He glanced over some of the papers lying before
him.</p>

<p>It was Jack who watched carefully, for
much was now at stake. As he saw the sheriff's
gaze averted, he parted his lips, and with
his tongue pushed forward the tiny cylinder
of paper, which on the instant of Nell's arrival,
he had placed in his mouth.</p>

<p>The wife perceived the protruding roll in
astonishment. Jack moved his head forward,
puckering his lips as for a kiss. Nell understood.
She turned instinctively. The sheriff's
eyes were still on his papers. At once,<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
then, the girl put her own lips to the opening
in the grating, where Jack's waited. The
mouths of the two met in a kiss that lingered.
The sheriff looked up, and saw the kiss. He
noted that the hands of the two were duly exposed,
as required by the regulation in such
case made and provided.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:360px">

 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">THE MOUTHS OF THE TWO MET IN A KISS THAT LINGERED.</p>

<p>Nell took her departure forthwith. Her
murmur of thanks to the sheriff for his kindness
was a trifle indistinct. That excellent officer
observed the fact. Also, he was inclined
to believe that the unfortunate young woman
appeared somewhat cheered by her visit to the
murderer&mdash;though what there could be cheering
in such a situation, the sheriff could not
guess.<span class="pagenum">[223]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p>In the solitude of her bleak chamber, Nell
hastened to take from her mouth the cylinder
of paper that Jack had given her.
Moist as it was, when unrolled it lay flat, and
the writing on the inner side was decipherable
without difficulty.</p>

<p>The note lacked address or signature, since
neither was needed. But the curt words filled
Nell with rapture:</p>

<blockquote><p>Have found way to escape. Go to Maxwell,
ask him for help. Have him somewhere
near the village on his side by eleven
o'clock to-night.</p></blockquote>

<p>With the reading, Nell took new heart of
hope. She could not guess the means that
her husband had devised for his escape from
the jail, but the confident tone in which he
had written to her gave promise of success.<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
Her own part in the plan was simple enough.
It only required that she act promptly in its
execution. It occurred to her that Mr. Maxwell
might be absent from the cabin, following
the line of his traps. The thought of possible
delay in the performance of her mission
struck a chill to the eager wife's heart. At
once, then, she was in a fever of impatience
to be off and away.</p>

<p>Nell made her preparations swiftly. At
her order, the dogs were harnessed to the sled,
and were ready at the door of the hotel, as she
issued forth. The news that the murderer's
bride was about to start out, spread through
the village like wild-fire. The sheriff himself
appeared on the scene, as Nell was at the point
of departure. He shook his head dolefully;
but, to the girl's immense relief, he did not
offer to detain her.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:354px">
 <a href="images/p248f.jpg">
 <img border="0" src="images/p248t.jpg" width="354" height="229" alt="p248t" title="" />
 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">THE DOGS WERE READY&mdash;AT THE DOOR OF THE HOTEL&mdash;AS SHE ISSUED FORTH.</p>

<p>"I dunno," he remarked doubtfully, "what
you git by goin', an' I dunno neither what
you'd git by stayin', fer the matter o' that.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, a wife can't testify agin her husband,<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
so I hain't got any call to hang on to
ye."</p>

<p>That was his valedictory.</p>

<p>Nell wasted neither words nor smiles on the
assembly. She had no kindly feeling toward
these men, who had dared accuse her husband
of crime. Her sole response to the sheriff's
statement was a crack of the whip and a lively
cry to the dogs, which leaped forward with
a speed and surety of movement in the splendidly
muscled bodies that made the watchers
exclaim admiringly.</p>

<p>There was now no leisurely progress, such
as had been that with which she and her husband
had traversed the miles together, before
death brought tragedy to their bridal-journey.
Nell, in two years of her living in the North,
had learned the management of these animals,
on which transportation over the snowy expanses
of the Arctic so depends. She knew
well how to get from her team every ounce of
speed, and she did not spare them in the least.
The crust still held, so that the going was of<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
the best. Mechanically, with the instinct that
develops quickly in those who live among the
wilds, Nell had noted each salient detail of the
route followed by her and Jack. So, now, she
was sure of her course, and drove the dogs at
full speed on and on, following the levels of
interwoven valleys with never a hint of hesitation.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon when, at last, Nell
found herself passing along the valley where
they had lingered behind the line of the stampede.
Hope mounted higher here; for only
a few miles still separated her from the man
whose aid she sought.</p>

<p>In turn, despair smote her at thought of the
possibility that this Mr. Maxwell might be
absent&mdash;might even not return that night.
She had a dreadful vision of Jack, escaped
from his prison, yet helpless, without dogs or
supplies, doomed to perish in the cold. She
resolved that, should other help be wanting,
she herself would return alone to meet him.
She took a little encouragement from this determination,
until it occurred to her that there<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
were limits to the endurance of the dogs.
Then, again, desolation fell on her. But, at
least, they would be together!... Thus, her
thoughts rioted in the stress of anxiety.</p>

<p>Anxiety became an anguished suspense,
when, finally, she saw the tiny bulk of the
cabin, showing darkly against the white of the
valley-slope. As the dogs raced nearer, she
stared with fierce eagerness to catch some sign
of life. She was in terror when she made sure
that no smoke issued from the chimney. One
does not sit at home fireless in the Far North.
A great fear was on her as she halted the dogs
before the cabin-door, and none came forth
to greet her.</p>

<p>Nell's misery, like that of most persons in
this world of mistaken ideas, was of her own
making. Hardly had she clambered down
stiffly from the sled, when the cabin-door
swung open, and Jim Maxwell stepped out.
At sight of his visitor, whom he recognized in
the first glance, he uttered an ejaculation of
astonishment, and advanced toward her
quickly. His thought on seeing her alone<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
thus before his cabin was that some serious accident
must have befallen her husband. He
was deeply concerned over the girl's plight,
and sympathy showed in his face with a sincerity
of feeling that touched the girl deeply&mdash;so
deeply, indeed, that for a few seconds
after he was come to her, she could only stand
wordless, with her hands in his firm clasp, her
eyes glowing with the gratitude and the relief
with which his presence inspired her.</p>

<p>Jim Maxwell's voice was softer than it had
been in more than a decade of years.</p>

<p>"Why, child, what's the matter?" he asked
soothingly. "Whatever it is, we'll make it
come out all right. Tell me about it."</p>

<p>Nell choked down her emotion, and presently
regained a fair degree of self-control.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad&mdash;so glad you're here, Mr.
Maxwell!" Her voice throbbed with feeling.
It stirred to a new life a joy long dead
in the man's bosom&mdash;joy in the realization that
some one wanted him. It had been twelve
years since any one had wanted him.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he repeated. His tone was even<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
gentler than before. The warmth of it
cheered the girl like a draft of rich wine.</p>

<p>Nell fumbled at her bosom for a moment,
and drew forth the note that Jack had written.
She held it out, and Jim Maxwell took it from
her, and read it through with growing astonishment.</p>

</div>

<p class="h5">JIM MAXWELL TOOK THE NOTE FROM HER AND READ IT THROUGH WITH GROWING ASTONISHMENT.</p>

<p>After he had scanned it for a second time,
he looked up at the expectant girl, with a puzzled,
though no less kindly, glance.</p>

<p>"But what does it all mean?" he asked. "I
suppose the note is from your husband?"</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Nell hurriedly. "He's going
to escape."</p>

<p>Jim patted the girl's hand reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Now, just take it easy," he counseled.
"You must remember that I don't know a
thing about it. So, you're going to tell me
everything that's happened, and what your
husband is going to escape from."</p>

<p>The calmness of the speaker's voice quieted
Nell's excitement, and she proceeded to relate
without confusion an outline of what had occurred.<span class="pagenum">[230]</span></p>

<p>"Poor little girl!" her listener said tenderly,
when the narrative was concluded. "Well,
he did right to send word to me. I owe you
two more than I can pay. And don't you
worry, my dear. This cloud will pass
quickly. The sunshine will be all the brighter
after the shadow." His manner changed, and
he spoke briskly. "Now, you get into the
cabin. I'd only just got back from my line
and kindled the fire when you came. The
stove, I guess, is about white-hot by now. I'll
attend to the dogs."</p>

<p>Nell went obediently, full of happy reliance
on the strength of this man, who was at
once so courteous and so kind. She smiled
over her distress of a few minutes before.
Now, a thick column of smoke rose into the
still air from the cabin-chimney.</p>

<p>Inside the tiny room, Nell glanced about
her with a curious sense of contentment.
There was something homelike in the aspect
of the place, despite its bareness. It was
plainly, even roughly, furnished with a few
tables and chairs besides the stove and bunk.<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
The only decorations were the skins that hung
on the log-walls. An oil-lamp was on a small
table in a corner. On the large table in the
opposite corner were some tins of meat, a
saucepan, a few pieces of heavy crockery, and
the like. Nell could not interpret the strange
effect wrought upon her by these surroundings.
She had felt it, in some measure, on the
occasion of her first visit to the cabin. Now,
however, its force seemed vastly stronger.
She puzzled over it in vain. She tried to
think it was the sense of relief that so affected
her. But she knew that this was not the explanation.
She had that inexplicable feeling
of being at home. There was no visible
cause. Whatever the reason, it lay beneath
the surface of things. It was something in
the atmosphere, some psychic quality.</p>

<p>It seemed to Nell that the impression made
upon her by this room in the cabin was intensified
by the entrance of the dweller there,
who greeted her with his friendly, gentle
smile. Indeed, the kindliness of that smile
and the look in the grave eyes touched the girl<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
anew to thankfulness that this man would devote
himself to her service in the time of need.
She thought to herself that Mr. Maxwell must
always have been a very kindly man to all,
because he smiled so easily, notwithstanding
the sadness of his face in repose. She could
not know that, through two-thirds of the years
measuring her span of life, Jim Maxwell had
not smiled at all.</p>

<p>"First," Jim commanded, "throw off the
outside things, and make yourself at home.
You're going to stay awhile."</p>

<p>Nell would have protested. But the man
raised a monitory hand.</p>

<p>"It's no use your arguing about it," he said;
and Nell recognized the masterful note in his
voice, though he spoke as gently as before.
She was rebellious, but she listened patiently
while he went on to explain.</p>

<p>"You see, my dear, this is men's work.
There might be a hitch somewhere. There
might even be a bit of a mix-up. You'd only
be in the way then, young lady. We may
have our hands full, without you on them.
Probably everything will be all right. Anyhow,
we'll do our best, and to do it we mustn't
be hampered by the presence of a non-combatant.
We'll come straight here as fast as
my dogs can bring us. That will give you a
chance to rest up. You'll just have to wait
here till we come. I don't say that that isn't
the hardest part of the whole job. But that's
woman's work&mdash;waiting."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[233]</span></p>


<p>Jim had spoken thus frankly and at length,
in the hope of avoiding useless discussion of
a matter concerning which discussion could
avail nothing, and he succeeded; for Nell
yielded at once, very meekly.</p>

<p>"You're right, of course," she said, unhappily.
"And you're right, too, about my having
the hardest part in just sitting here with
my hands folded, while I don't know what is
happening to Jack."</p>

<p>"Better unfold them," Jim suggested with
a chuckle, "and rustle yourself some grub."
He waved his hand toward the larger table.
"The larder is quite at your service. As for
me, I'll get ready and start at once. That'll<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
get me to the edge of Kalmak soon after dark,
so that I'll be all ready and waiting&mdash;just like
you!&mdash;for whatever's to happen."</p>

<p>"Yes," Nell said, and again there was the
emphasis of anxiety in her voice, "you must
start at once. You must be there, ready for
Jack when he comes."</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of this decision on the part of
both that the man should start immediately,
it was ordained by the Fates that there should
be some delay; for this was an hour fraught
with momentous things for the two thus cast
together in the solitary cabin on the mountainside.</p>

<p>It was as Jim Maxwell began his preparations
for the journey that he chanced&mdash;or that
he was guided&mdash;to stand close to the girl, facing
her. His eyes were caught by a golden
gleam, which seemed pulsing, as it moved in
the rhythm of her breathing. His gaze rested
there idly at first. And then, a moment later,
his attention was drawn to a more careful
scrutiny&mdash;just why, he did not know. Perhaps,
as some maintain, a secret, tenuous vibration<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
emanated from the metal, and moved
to response a sleeping memory of old associations
in the man's soul. Whatever the cause,
Jim Maxwell's eyes were seized and held fast
by the locket lying on Nell's breast.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, he started violently. He
thrust his head forward, with a movement so
abrupt, almost threatening in its seeming, that
the girl, in her turn, was startled, and withdrew
a step, half-fearful.</p>

<p>"I want to see that locket you are wearing."
Jim Maxwell spoke in a tone that Nell had
not heard before. It rang with a note of
command not to be denied. She gazed affrighted
at the change in his face. The kindliness
was fled from it. It was imperious,
ruthless, with a trace of underlying savagery.
The young wife was dazed by the metamorphosis
in the man on whom depended now her
husband's rescue. And she was afraid, as well&mdash;no
longer with a doubtful fear, but with a
real terror before the expression in that
heavily lined face, out of which the eyes stared
at her with a cruel insistence.<span class="pagenum">[236]</span></p>

<p>"I want to see that locket you are wearing,"
he repeated harshly, and held out his right
hand with the palm upward to receive it.</p>

<p>Without a word, Nell took off the chain
from her neck, and dropped it with the locket
into the waiting palm. Then, she moved a
little aside, shrinking from the new being with
whom she found herself. But, after a few seconds,
she forgot her own emotion, her alarm,
her anxiety in behalf of her husband. For
she was looking on the soul of a man, bared in
agony. So great and so terrible was that revelation
that, very quickly, she turned her
gaze aside that she might not see.</p>

<p>Jim Maxwell remained with his eyes fixed
on the little locket, which bore for an ornament
an initial <i>N</i> traced in tiny pearls. He
could not doubt. It was the locket that he
had caused to be made for his daughter, for
Nell&mdash;his little girl! Presently, he would
open it, to see if the pictures of Lou and of
himself were still within. But, in this first
burst of emotion, he could only stand moveless
there, racked by all the torments of memory.<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
It was the tearing open of wounds, which,
though they had never healed, had ceased to
bleed. Now, they bled afresh, and it seemed
to him that his soul was drowning in the blood.</p>

<p>The fierceness of his first emotion passed.
Suddenly, it was as if a cloud lifted from his
brain, and he became aware of himself standing
there in the cabin. A moment before&mdash;or
was it ages?&mdash;he had been in heaven&mdash;and
in hell. Now, he was back in the cabin in the
wilderness. And he was glad to be there, for
it was home....</p>

<p>Again, his attention was caught by the gleam
of the gold within his hands. He recognized
the locket. But, at last, he was able to accept
its presence with some degree of calm.</p>

<p>Jim Maxwell turned to the girl, and addressed
her gently enough, but still with that
dominant tone which would brook no denial.</p>

<p>"Where did you get this locket?"</p>

<p>"I have had it always," she answered.
None could doubt her truth as she spoke, with
the clear eyes meeting her questioner's stern
gaze squarely.<span class="pagenum">[238]</span></p>

<p>The severity of the man's expression yielded
a little.</p>

<p>"Who gave it to you?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>Jim frowned at this check.</p>

<p>"But you must know," he insisted.</p>

<p>Nell shook her head resolutely.</p>

<p>"I do not remember who gave it to me," she
repeated. "But I don't remember anything
about myself when I was a very little girl.
I've had the locket always, just as far back as
I can remember."</p>

<p>"How far back can you remember?" It
was a perfunctory question.</p>

<p>"Papa and Mamma Ross, who saved me
from the river, guessed that I was five or six
years old. They decided on calling it six."</p>

<p>"And you had the locket then?"</p>

<p>Nell nodded assent again.</p>

<p>"And how old are you now?"</p>

<p>"I'm just eighteen."</p>

<p>As his brain took in the figures, and made a
mechanical calculation, Jim Maxwell's form,
which had relaxed a little, grew tense again.<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
His eyes searched the girl's face with a strange
hunger in the intensity of the gaze. Twelve
years! Twelve years ago, this girl here before
him, who knew nothing as to her life
prior to that time, had been saved from a river.
And she had worn the locket that he had
caused to be fashioned for his daughter, Nell.
And twelve years ago his wife and his daughter,
Nell, had vanished. The incredible
crowded in his thoughts. Could mother and
child, by an evil stroke of fate, have been
caught somewhere in treacherous waters?
Could one have perished, and the other have
escaped? Could this girl, who stood there
wondering at him&mdash;could she be that child,
his little Nell, grown to this splendid womanhood?
The thoughts electrified him. Was
it possible that there was still left for him in
life this supreme consolation&mdash;a creature
whom he might love with all his heart, who
would love him in return?</p>

<p>But Jim Maxwell dared not believe. He
was afraid of hope, lest it become despair to
destroy him. Yet, the chief influences that<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
wrought upon him were his own desire that
this miracle might be truth, and the new and
singular yearning of his heart toward Nell.</p>

<p>Presently, Jim Maxwell approached the
girl where she was standing a little aloof.
He reached out and put his hand on her arm.
The girl started at his touch, but, for some
reason she could not understand, she did not
shrink from him now. He spoke very softly;
and in his voice there was a music that penetrated
to the girl's soul.</p>

<p class="h5">THE GIRL STARTED AT HIS TOUCH BUT SHE DID NOT SHRINK FROM HIM NOW.</p>

<p>"You are my daughter&mdash;my little Nell!...
God has given you back to me."</p>

<p>The girl did not doubt. As with the man,
her own yearning bore witness. She offered
no resistance, but yielded with a reverent joy
to the caress, as her father turned her about
until she faced him, then stooped and kissed
her on the forehead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p>In the tedious hours of waiting after parting
from Nell, Jack Reeves was infinitely
cheered by the consciousness that he would
have for an ally in this crisis one such as Jim
Maxwell. Often, there came into the prisoner's
thought a memory of how he had last
seen the trapper. He had turned for a look
back as the sled dropped to the level of the
valley. The solitary dweller in that wild
place had been standing erect and motionless
before the cabin&mdash;a splendid figure of a man,
posed in unconscious majesty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:217px">
 <a href="images/p259f.jpg">
 <img border="0" src="images/p259t.jpg" width="217" height="333" alt="p259t" title="" />
 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">A SPLENDID FIGURE OF A MAN, POSED IN UNCONSCIOUS MAJESTY.</p>

<p>There was, of course, the risk that Jim
Maxwell might be away from the cabin and
so not available to render assistance. That
risk, however, could not be avoided, since
there was no one else to whom appeal might
be made. But Jack was able to hold an optimistic
frame of mind. Somehow the effect<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
made upon him by the stranger whom he and
Nell had rescued from death was such that
he felt a certain confidence as to the outcome
of his plan, merely because it depended vitally
on the co&ouml;peration of Jim Maxwell. Jack
was sure that he could have secured this assistance,
even had there been no sense of obligation
to bind the stranger to his service.
With Jim Maxwell's obvious and profound
gratitude for having been rescued from death,
there could be no doubt concerning his response
to the prisoner's call for help.</p>

<p>Though he was busy with thoughts concerning
his projected flight, Jack found the
day dragging endlessly. It seemed an eternity
before at last the shadows lengthened into
night. Then, indeed, when patience was least
needed, it became most difficult. Now that
the time was so near at hand, the minutes
crawled with a sluggishness that was exasperating.
It seemed to Jack that the sheriff purposed
to sit in the adjoining room throughout
the night. It was only when he looked at his
watch that the fretting captive learned how<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
anxiety deceived him, for it yet lacked a half-hour
of the official's usual retiring time.</p>

<p>Finally, since all things have an end, the
sheriff stood up, and, after an amiable but
formal good-night, went out into the living-quarters
of the house. Followed an hour that
was still more laggard than any of those that
had preceded it in this most laggard day.
Jack had decided that there could be no need
of waiting until late at night before making
his attempt. There were only two classes
among the citizens of the town. One went to
bed early; the other went very late&mdash;if at all.
The prisoner hoped that the first class would
sleep too soundly to have any knowledge of
his undertaking until too late to thwart it;
that the second class would be too drunk for
serious interference.</p>

<p>When he deemed it time to begin his preparations
for escape, Jack gathered the most inflammable
parts of the litter on the floor.
There was more than sufficient for his purpose,
since the sheriff, however great his other
official virtues, was by no manner of means a<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
tidy person. This collection of fragments of
paper and wood was stacked against the partition
that separated the cell from the outer
room, midway on one side of the door. The
prisoner was at pains to use only paper and
splinters, which would burn with little smoke.
He had chosen the only possible point of attack
for his purpose. The other three walls
of the cell were of heavy timbers, which could
have been set on fire only with difficulty, and,
once well alight, would have assuredly roasted
to death any one in the place, since there could
have been no possibility of breaking through
them.</p>

<p>The situation was different as to the wall
in which the door was set. This was made of
boards, instead of logs. They were too heavy
to be broken through by blows from the heavy
chair, which was the only tool available to the
prisoner. Jack had conceived the possibility
of setting fire to some of the lower boards,
and thus weakening them to a point where
they would yield to his attack. So, now,<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
when he had placed his kindling in position,
he made ready with the match.</p>

<p>Never was a match struck more carefully.
It was the only one, and on its aid at the outset
the whole attempt of escape rested. Jack
breathed a prayer of thanksgiving as the
match sputtered and flared to a steady flame.
Next moment paper and sticks were burning
briskly. The fire mounted, lapping gently at
the boards of the wall.</p>

<p>Jack, kneeling closely, watched earnestly.
There was nothing more for him to do now;
he had only to wait for his servant, the fire,
to prepare the way. He shuddered a little
at the thought that the servant might become
the master&mdash;that in the end he might perish
miserably in a fire-trap of his own devising.</p>

<p>He stood up, and, by an effort of will, thrust
the thought from him, lest fear drain him of
the energy needed for the flight to come. He
forced himself to think of anything else,
rather than of a failure so horrible&mdash;of Nell,
who would be waiting for him in a mood of<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
hope and despair intermingled; of Jim Maxwell,
who would be ready in this time of need.
He pictured the trapper with his dogs, waiting
patiently on the snow where the spruce
shadows fell.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:351px">
 <a href="images/p269f.jpg">
 <img border="0" src="images/p269t.jpg" width="351" height="231" alt="p269t" title="" />
 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">THE TRAPPER, WITH HIS DOGS, WAITING PATIENTLY ON THE SNOW.</p>

<p>The flame rose higher and higher. The
dry boards in the partition were smoking.
Little lines of sparks ran over the rough surface,
then died. The smoke from the boards
grew heavier. The acrid odor filled the cell.
Jack coughed and dropped again to his knees,
in order to avoid the worst of the fumes. The
heat increased, but it was not sufficient to
cause any particular discomfort. Jack had
vastly more fear that the increasing volume of
smoke might overcome him before he should
have opportunity for carrying out his project.
Presently, however, he was greatly heartened
by observing that there was draft which
carried the greater part of the smoke out of
the cell through the grating in the door. As
he looked, he saw that the other room was
filled already with dense clouds of smoke.
He took further comfort from the fact that<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
the fumes were not apparently escaping into
the main body of the house, where they might
have given the alarm.</p>

<p>In the cell, the lower boards of the partition
had burst into flame. The heat from
them was now so great that Jack crawled
away from it into the farthest corner. The
tiny room was like an oven, and to add to the
discomfort of it and the deadly danger, the
smoke thickened visibly, notwithstanding the
current passing out through the door.</p>

<p>Jack realized, with a thrill of horror, that
here was a duel&mdash;a duel to the death. It was
a duel between him and those fiercely darting
flames. Rather, it was a duel between him
and those blazing boards in the partition&mdash;a
duel of endurance between him and them.
Which would be the first to yield? If the
boards should hold out the longer, then he&mdash;!
Jack shuddered once again, with a wry smile
over the irony of fate. Here, in this rigorous
climate, men went often hand-in-hand with a
Death whose scythe was edged with ice.
Jack had contemplated the possibility of being<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>
some time struck down by the numbing
cold. It had never occurred to him that in
this Arctic land he might die in a hell of his
own stoking.</p>

<p>The stifling prisoner dared hope that at last
the blaze had weakened the boards sufficiently
for his purpose. Whether or no, his suffering
drove him to action. The heat was intolerable
now. Sweat poured from him. The
pungent smoke blinded him, and bit cruelly
at throat and lungs. Still without rising to
his feet, Jack laid hold of the chair, which was
just beside him, and hobbled clumsily toward
the partition, pushing the chair before him.</p>

<p>Even this comparatively slight exertion
caused the perspiration to gush in new abundance,
and here, closer to the flame, the temperature
was well-nigh unbearable. Jack's
head swam. He felt his senses failing. It
was only by a tremendous effort that he regained
control of himself. He was aware of
his mortal peril. Any least weakening or faltering
now would mean his destruction. It
was, indeed, a duel to the death&mdash;a duel of
endurance between him and a foe that knew
no mercy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[249]</span></p>


<p>Jack realized, as well, that there could be
no delay in the issue. He must act at once,
if he were to act at all. A minute later would
be forever too late. His brain was reeling.
His agonized flesh could not longer withstand
the strain. He felt his energies flow out of
him like water.... What he would do must
be done instantly&mdash;or not at all.</p>

<p>Jack drew a long breath, sprang up, swung
the chair, and brought it crashing against the
boards of the partition where the flames
burned most furiously. The wall did not
break, though it seemed to yield a little under
the blow. But, before he could try another
assault, dizziness sent him staggering away
from the unbearable heat and smoke of that
spot. He dropped to the floor, where he lay
stretched at full length, panting in choking
breaths. For a few seconds he was in the
grip of despair. He felt himself impotent,
doomed to shameful death in this furnace-hole.<span class="pagenum">[250]</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the spirit of the young man,
albeit fainting, was not dead. It aroused
presently. And it quickened the flesh. Once
again Jack acted. His brain was dulled.
He was hardly conscious of thought. The
whole strength of his being was concentrated
in his will to make a last, supreme effort.
Again, after a deep breath, he leaped to his
feet, seized the chair and hurled it against the
center of the flaming mass with every atom of
his strength.</p>

<p>In the interval since his first attempt, the
fire that threatened him with death had, notwithstanding,
been working in his behalf,
weakening still more the boards, his enemies
in this duel of endurance. The heavy chair
burst through the blazing barrier and fell
noisily in the other room.</p>

<p>Joy surged in the prisoner. Under the
stimulus of it, he forgot pain and feebleness.
He rushed at the flaming wall and kicked
clear a larger opening. Then he plunged
through the flames.</p>

<p>Jack fell headlong on the floor of the sheriff's<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
office. By instinct, he remained prostrate,
with his face against the floor, else he
must have strangled. But instinct urged him
onward. He crept toward the window,
which, fortunately, was on the side of the
room where he had fallen. His eyes were
shut fast now, for the smoke had blinded him.
But his groping hand, upraised, found the
window-sash. Once more Jack held his
scant breath as he got to his feet. He drove
his elbows through the panes. The zero air
enwrapped him. The touch of it was bliss.
It brought blessed life to the seared lungs.
Jack took one great breath of it. Then he put
a foot to the window-ledge, drew himself up
and went through, amid the noise of rending
glass and wood. Without an instant of pause,
or a single glance backward, he was off, plowing
his way through the heaped-up snow,
which bordered the clear space beyond the
buildings. In another minute he was on the
solid crust. Thus he ran on in a line parallel
with the one street of the village, but behind
the buildings that straggled there. He passed<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>
the last of these, and saw before him the white
reaches of the valley, without sign of life anywhere,
beckoning him on to freedom. His
stride quickened and he went forward jubilantly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:357px">

 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">WITHOUT AN INSTANT PAUSE, HE WAS OFF, PLOWING HIS WAY THROUGH THE SNOW.</p>

<p>A hail came to Jack's ears. He looked in
the direction of the sound and saw, a little to
the right of the trail, a ghostly silhouette, even
as he had pictured it&mdash;the trapper, with his
dogs, waiting patiently on the snow where the
spruce shadows fell.<span class="pagenum">[253]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p>Nell, standing before the cabin-door,
peered for the hundredth time that
night across the valley. Her eyes seemed to
catch in the far distance a hint of movement,
a flickering shadow out there in the dim light
of snow beneath starlight. It was gone in
the same instant. It must have been a trickery
of vision. No! there it was again&mdash;a
shadow that moved, a tiniest speck, but real.
Nell's hands went to her bosom convulsively.
It could be none other than Mr. Maxwell&mdash;her
father&mdash;coming there. Did he come
alone? She stood with straining eyes in a
torment of doubt. Soon she was able to make
out that only one figure ran with the moving
sled. It was as if the heart died in her.
Then, in the next moment, she thought that
she could distinguish vaguely the outlines of
another form on the sled. She was a-tremble<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
with hope. The sled rushed toward her up
the slope, the wearied dogs mending their
pace in the frantic delight of home-coming.
It was certainty now. Nell could see the man
on the sled. He waved a hand to her. A cry
of rapture burst from her lips. Within the
minute, she was clasped to her husband's
breast&mdash;all sorrows forgot.</p>

<p>Presently, when the first excitement of the
reunion was over, and the three were together
in the cheery warmth of the cabin, Jack told
his story very briefly, whereat Nell paled and
trembled as she realized how near to death
this night had been the man she loved. But,
when the fugitive finished the story with his
arrival at the point where Jim Maxwell
waited, Nell suddenly rose and went to the

and kissed him.</p>

<p class="h5">WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE REUNION WAS OVER, JACK TOLD HIS STORY.</p>

<p>"Father, if it hadn't been for you&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Jack regarded the scene in amazement, not
untinged by disapproval. Gratitude was all
very well, but it need not express itself too
extravagantly. Then he almost forgot the<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
embrace in wonder over the word&mdash;"father!"</p>

<p>"Eh?" he questioned confusedly. "You've
adopted him? That is, he's adopted you?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" Nell exclaimed, drawing away from
her father to regard him with consternation.
"Didn't you tell him?"</p>

<p>Jim Maxwell smiled very tenderly.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't tell him. I thought maybe
you'd like to do that yourself, dear."</p>

<p>Nell kissed her father again, with such enthusiasm
that Jack's disapproval returned
with increased bitterness.</p>

<p>"You're a darling, Father," she declared
happily. In the reaction from her suffering,
she was bubbling over with girlish gayety.
"I'd just love to tell him. It will be such fun
to see his eyes pop out."</p>

<p>It was fun&mdash;and something deeper and
sweeter. Jack, for his part, welcomed the
fact of this new relationship with the man
so curiously and intimately brought into his
life. He rejoiced for his own sake, and he
rejoiced more for Nell's; since now she need
no longer mourn over being a nameless waif,<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>
though the mystery of her life was only partly
explained.</p>

<p>The hands of the two met in a warm clasp,
and their eyes met no less warmly in a firm,
honest gaze of mutual liking and respect.</p>

<p>"I reckon I've done a pretty good day's
work," Jim said, with a whimsical smile to
mask his emotion. "I've got a daughter and
a son, too&mdash;both in one day. And I didn't
have anybody before&mdash;not for twelve years."
There was a pathetic intensity in his voice,
which touched the two hearers to a new appreciation
of this man's great loneliness.
Then Jim Maxwell shrugged his shoulders, as
if he would cast off the mood of emotion. He
spoke rapidly now, with incisive directness.</p>

<p>"You must get across the Border as fast as
you can. I'll tell you some short cuts." He
had driven his dogs often to Malamute, and
knew the ways by which the fugitives might
gain advantage over their pursuers. "You've
had an hour here, and it would be risky to wait
any longer before starting out. They may be
after you any minute."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[257]</span></p>

<br />

<div class="figcenter" style="width:357px">
 <a href="images/p279f.jpg">

 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">HE HAD OFTEN DRIVEN HIS DOGS TO MALAMUTE.</p>

<p>"They may think I've been burned up in
the fire," Jack suggested.</p>

<p>Jim shook his head in dissent.</p>

<p>"No. Those logs would take a good bit of
burning. Somebody would give the alarm,
and they'd tumble out to see the fire, and
they'd see that window you'd smashed
through."</p>

<p>"And I had to wade through some loose
snow," Jack added. "They'd find my tracks
fast enough."</p>

<p>"Tracks leading this way! I tell you,
there's no time to be lost. You know the
trails to Malamute. Make it as quick as
you can. From there, strike across the Border."</p>

<p>He was interrupted by Nell, who exclaimed
impulsively:</p>

<p>"But, Father, what about you? I can't
bear the thought of leaving you now, when
I've just found you after all these years."</p>

<p>Jim Maxwell smiled down on his daughter
with deep fondness.</p>

<p>"When you're in Canada, write to me here&mdash;to<span class="pagenum">[258]</span>
Kalmak, telling me where you will be,
and I'll join you very soon."</p>

<p>He turned to Jack and gave explicit directions
as to how the route to Malamute might
be shortened profitably. When he was sure
that the young man had understood, he turned
again to Nell.</p>

<p>"I'm not quite so poor as I look, little girl,"
he said, smiling. "When I join you I'll have
a wedding-present ready for you&mdash;for you,
and for the boy here." His glance went affectionately
to Jack, who returned it with like
affection.</p>

<p>Preparations for the departure of the two
were speedily made. The farewells were uttered;
father and daughter kissed tenderly;
the men shook hands heartily. Then the
dogs, in fine fettle after ample food and rest,
leaped forward with joyous energy. The
night was clear enough to see the way distinctly;
there was no danger of mistaking the
trail. On and on they flew over the frozen
surface of the snow, following the valleys that
trended to the east. Warmly clad and habituated<span class="pagenum">[259]</span>
to icy airs, the two did not suffer any
discomfort from the bitter cold of the wind
created by their rapid motion through the
night. On the contrary, it set their blood
tingling with the joy of life. Both were gloriously
happy. The starlight was as noon-day
since they had come out of the valley of the
shadow.</p>

<p>Thus they went forward swiftly, Nell
stretched at ease, Jack riding and running by
turns. In the twilight of dawn, they came on
a native family comfortably encamped, and
here they halted for an hour, that the dogs
might be fed and rested, and that they, too,
might eat and rest. They basked contentedly
in the cheery heat from the flames, and at last
took leave of their stolid hosts almost reluctantly.
Then, once again, they went skimming
over the waste, as the pale-yellow sun
crept languidly above the horizon. The
slanting beams set all the scene a-shimmer
with prismatic radiance from the snow crystals.
Hitherto, the two had been content with
silence, happy in the knowledge that they<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
were together and that the speeding miles put
peril far behind. Now, however, with the
quickening life of day, the placid mood came
to an end. They became lively, garrulous,
demonstrative. Nell insisted that Jack
should rehearse for her anew every detail of
his escape from the jail. The husband, in
turn, demanded a full account of how father
and daughter had become known to each
other. Both were curious to know the story
of Jim Maxwell's life. They could not forbear
many speculations as to the nature of the
events that had driven this man, whom Jack
liked and esteemed, and whom Nell had already
grown to love, to isolate himself thus in
the desolate North. But they could only
guess, since the father had told nothing of
himself, except the single fact of his relationship
to Nell.</p>

<p>They made Malamute in mid-afternoon.
Jack halted the dogs in front of the chief
structure in the place, which, though nominally
only a saloon, was in fact the hotel and
trading post.<span class="pagenum">[261]</span></p>

<p>"Don't get out, Nell," Jack directed. "I'll
have to get directions here for the next stage
in the journey. Maybe we'll have to stay for
the night, and maybe we won't. I'll be back
in a minute." With that he hurried off and
entered the saloon.</p>

<p>As the door swung open to admit the newcomer,
the few men straggling along the bar,
or lounging at the tables, looked up in mild
curiosity to see who this might be. Only one
showed any especial interest in the stranger.
This single exception was a man who sat by
a table placed against the wall at right angles
to the bar. He had been lazily busy over a
game of solitaire, while the woman seated
across the table from him looked on listlessly.
At Jack's entrance, he had looked up with
languid attention. On the instant, he was
transformed. All the indifference of his expression
vanished. His face showed first an
unbounded amazement, then rage. Finally,
another emotion&mdash;hardly fear, but a furtive
anxiety closely akin to fear. He watched
covertly as the escaped prisoner went up to the<span class="pagenum">[262]</span>
bar, where, after ordering a drink, he began
questioning the bartender concerning the
most direct route to the Border.</p>

<p>Having secured the information he required,
Jack went back to Nell, who sat waiting
on the sled, snug within her furs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:350px">
 <a href="images/p296f.jpg">
 <img border="0" src="images/p296t.jpg" width="350" height="228" alt="p296t" title="" />
 </a>
</div>

<p class="h5">JACK WENT BACK TO NELL, WHO SAT ON THE SLED, SNUG WITHIN HER FURS.</p>

<p>"We'd better stay here for the night," he
explained, "and make an early start in the
morning."</p>

<p>Nell got down from the sled obediently and
accompanied her husband into the saloon,
where arrangements for their entertainment
were speedily concluded. It was only after
the two had gone upstairs to the room assigned
them that the man, who had held his head bent
low over the spread-out cards of the solitaire
game during their presence, looked up and
beckoned to a tall, rough-featured individual
standing alone at one end of the bar. This
was the sheriff of Malamute. As he came
near, Dan McGrew spoke, and his voice
rasped.</p>

<p>"Did you recognize that chap with the
girl?"<span class="pagenum">[263]</span></p>

<p>"Never laid eyes on him before," the official
averred. "What about it?"</p>

<p>"When I was down at Kalmak the other
day," Dangerous Dan answered impressively,
"they arrested that fellow for murder. He's
broken jail."</p>

<p>The sheriff grinned contentedly.</p>

<p>"Then right here's where he breaks in
again. I'll see to that. You're sure there's
no mistake?"</p>

<p>"No mistake!" was the terse assurance.
"I'll swear to his identity if necessary. But
probably there'll be somebody after him
pretty soon, as they'd figure he'd take this way
for the Border."</p>

<p>"I thought you were going in the morning,"
the sheriff objected. "I'll have to
have you for a witness, if nobody else turns
up."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll stay, all right!" Dan laughed.</p>

<p>And the Fates must have laughed with him,
and at him, in mockery; for, in this last malignant
act, Dangerous Dan McGrew worked
evil against himself and none other.... Lou,<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
looking on apathetically, wondered why Dan
should be so eager to deliver over a fugitive
from justice. He was not usually so intolerant
of crime!<span class="pagenum">[265]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p>Jim Maxwell, left alone in his cabin,
had company a-plenty in thronging
thoughts. His mood, on the whole, was
nearer to one of happiness than any he had
known before in the years since the wrecking
of his home. The discovery of his daughter
had filled him with pure delight. Had she
been other than she was, this recovery of her
would still have filled him with gladness. To
find her so lovely and so winsome in her personality
moved him to proud exaltation. He
looked forward to companionship with her in
the years to come, and thanked Providence
for this assuagement of past loneliness and
sorrow. He was grateful, too, for the fact
that she had entrusted her life's happiness to
one who seemed worthy, so far as any man
might be, of such a treasure. Since he had<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
no son of his own, Jim Maxwell rejoiced over
this gift of his daughter's bringing to him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was in this connection that
the otherwise happy father found ground for
anxiety, and that anxiety pressed upon him
heavily. His understanding of the circumstances,
which was wider than that of the
young persons involved, made him appreciate
the evil consequence that must ensue from the
present situation. Either Jack would escape
across the Border, or he would not. In the
latter contingency, there would be immediate
peril of his life on being brought back to Kalmak;
for Jim had been told, what Nell had
not, of the probable lynching by men impatient
of the law's delay. But, with the fugitive's
escape safely accomplished, there would
remain always a stigma on the young man's
reputation. Throughout his life, he would
go in constant danger of being pointed out as
a jail-breaker and murderer. Jim Maxwell
would not tolerate such a fate for one near
and dear to him, and dearest to his daughter.
He made a last round of his traps, bringing<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
them in and storing them in the cabin preparatory
to his departure. And in his progress
over the miles, his thoughts were grappling
always with the problems by which he
was confronted. It was not until nightfall,
as he sat smoking cozily in the warm comfort
of the cabin, which had been blest by his
daughter's presence, that he at last reached a
decision. He had little fear of a lynching in
case of Jack's recapture; for he meant to take
a hand himself in coming events, and he believed
that the sheriff at Kalmak, though he
knew the official to be of a spineless sort,
would make a stand against the mob with his
backing. So he dismissed any immediate
concern over the retaking of the escaped prisoner.
There remained, however, the matter
of the stigma. He would not let his son-in-law,
Nell's husband, whom she loved, be thus
branded by the world. There was only one
means of prevention. The young man's innocence
must be proved. With the evidence
against him such as it was, that innocence
could be established in a single way, and in<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
none other&mdash;by proving the identity of Sam
Ward's actual slayer. Since this was so, Jim
Maxwell decided that he himself must bend
every energy to tracing out the truth concerning
the crime of which Jack Reeves stood
accused. Before he slept that night, he resolved
that with the dawn he would start for
Kalmak, there to begin his work.</p>

<p>In the morning, then, Jim Maxwell set
forth on his quest. On arrival at Kalmak, he
halted his dogs before the Grand Hotel,
where he judged, from a slight acquaintance
with the sheriff, that he would find the official
in the bar-room. In this he was proven
right; for, on entering the saloon, the first
person his gaze encountered was the sheriff
himself, who stood at the end of the bar facing
the door, with an expression of profound
melancholy upon his horse-like face. Jim,
with only a nod to the others, went straight to
the sheriff, whom he greeted with an assumption
of deference, since he was well aware of
the fellow's pet vanity.</p>

<p>"And what's new?" he asked innocently,<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>
after he had given an order to the bar-tender.</p>

<p>The sheriff could hardly pause to drain his
glass, so eager was he to pour out his woes
to one who had not yet heard them. There
was nothing in the narrative that increased the
stock of information already possessed by the
questioner. It was not until Jim Maxwell
had pursued a cross-examination for some time
that there came a revelation of importance.
This, when it did come, crashed on him like
a thunderbolt.</p>

<p>"Have there been any other strangers in
the place lately?" he demanded, desirous of
any clew to the possible murderer.</p>

<p>"Nary one," the sheriff responded dismally.
"It's been dull as ditch-water all winter hereabouts.
Hain't anybody come in for a month&mdash;leastways,
only Dan McGrew, and he ain't
a stranger exactly&mdash;not by a long shot!"</p>

<p>Dan McGrew! The name screamed in Jim
Maxwell's brain. Dan McGrew, here&mdash;within
reach of his two hands!</p>

<p>He stood motionless, unhearing, unseeing.
Beneath the concealing beard, his cheeks were<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
bloodless. His thoughts were chaos. The
despair of the years seemed crystallized in this
new anguish over the fact that the enemy had
been here, almost within his grasp, and he
had not known. He seemed to realize as
never before the monstrousness of the crime
committed against him. Hate more savage
than he had known hitherto filled his heart
with its black flood. It seemed the final
crushing blow of fate, that the wrecker of his
home should have come so nearly within his
power and then have escaped unscathed.
For, somehow, he sensed details given by the
sheriff concerning Dan McGrew's going from
Kalmak, though he heard not a word of the
babbling voice.</p>

<p>Presently, Jim Maxwell aroused from this
trance of rage. He found himself weak and
shaken, and his tone was husky as he ordered
more drinks for himself and for the gratified
sheriff. He gulped the raw liquor hurriedly,
and welcomed the sting of it. He regained
his usual stern composure soon, and, immediately
then, his thoughts took a new turn. He<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
resumed the prosecution of his inquiries with
increased eagerness. It may have been that
the association of ideas drove him on. Dan
McGrew was to him the epitome of crime.
The presence of Dan McGrew in the neighborhood
struck him as of possible significance.
He was without a shred of evidence, in the
matter of Sam Ward's death, against the man
he hated. Yet, he felt a strange conviction
that here was the clew for which he had
been searching.... The sheriff was highly
pleased by the manifest interest of this trapper,
who, in their previous meetings, had
shown no trace of geniality.</p>

<p>"You say this Dan McGrew&mdash;" Jim stumbled
a little over the name&mdash;"was here when
this Reeves chap came in?"</p>

<p>"Blew in that very self-same day, jest a little
while before the murderer got here."</p>

<p>"I suppose he hadn't heard of the murder
until he got here?" Jim suggested.</p>

<p>The sheriff shook his head.</p>

<p>"We didn't any of us know a thing about
Sam Ward having been killed, until the young<span class="pagenum">[272]</span>
feller drove up and told that cussed yarn about
seein' the murder through his glasses. The
nerve of him! And he'd got away with it,
too, if it hadn't been for Dan McGrew puttin'
it into my head to search his pack."</p>

<p>The listener started perceptibly at this information.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was Dan McGrew who first directed
suspicion against this young man, was it?"</p>

<p>The sheriff was deeply chagrined by his inadvertent
revelation of the truth. He attempted
to hedge.</p>

<p>"Why, not exactly. Maybe he was the first
to speak right out plain, but I'd been thinkin'
jest that same thing."</p>

<p>Jim did not care to press the point. He
had no wish to wound the sheriff's sensibilities,
at least while further information might
be extracted from the man. But he regarded
this news concerning the part Dan McGrew
had played in the affair as of vital importance.
While the sheriff maundered on, he rapidly
reviewed the details of the case, so far as he
knew them.
<span class="pagenum">[273]</span></p>


<p>The murderer, according to Jack's account,
must have seen the approach of the bridal
pair. The fact was, indeed, proven by his
hasty flight from the scene of the crime.
Thereafter, he might have watched, and probably
had watched, the arrival of the sled, and
he doubtless had been aware that the newcomers
camped on the creek for the night.
Already, in previous study of the questions involved,
Jim had arrived at these conclusions,
which established a plausible explanation for
the presence of the knife-handle in Jack's
pack. Certainly, it could have been no difficult
feat for the assassin to secrete this evidence
during the night encampment. As certainly,
there could have been no other opportunity.
Nor could there be any doubt as to
the motive for the action. It had been for the
purpose of fixing guilt upon the innocent, that
the guilty might go free.</p>

<p>Now, in addition to these conclusions already
established, there appeared another and
salient fact.</p>

<p>The person who first suggested the searching<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>
of the pack wherein the knife-handle
lay concealed had been Dan McGrew. The
inference was undeniable. It was made
stronger still by the correlated fact that Dan
McGrew had arrived at Kalmak only shortly
before the coming of the alleged murderer.
By further questioning, Jim drew from the
loquacious sheriff additional data. Dangerous
Dan had arrived on foot. He had talked
of having been in the stampede; but he had
given no precise account of his movements,
nor had he explained the reason for his coming
to Kalmak, over which the sheriff had
puzzled. The day following his arrival, he
had set out for Malamute with a hired outfit.</p>

<p>A rapid survey of all these circumstances
brought Jim Maxwell to the conviction that
Dangerous Dan McGrew had added murder
to his other crimes. The evidence was by no
means conclusive, but it was sufficient to any
one reasoning from the facts. Jim, sure of
Jack's innocence, regarded the guilt of Dan
McGrew as actually established. There remained
the necessity of final proof, which<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>
would brand the murderer as such before the
world and clear the innocent from unjust suspicion.</p>

<p>It was reasonable to suppose that the slayer
of Sam Ward had taken to himself, in payment
for his crime, anything of value on the
dead man's body. Thus there was a possibility,
even a probability, that Dangerous Dan
McGrew now carried with him some tangible
evidence that would serve to convict him.
This evidence must be secured. In no other
way could the innocence of Jack Reeves be
proclaimed to the world. And Dangerous
Dan had gone to Malamute. Jim smiled
slowly, staring fixedly, as if his gaze reached
out across the miles. The sheriff, though
hardly a coward, shrank a little from some
strange quality in that look.</p>

<p>Jim Maxwell, in truth, was wondering as
to his exact purpose in going to Malamute.
Was it to save Jack Reeves, or was it to kill
Dangerous Dan McGrew? Both, perhaps.</p>

<p>He put a last question to the sheriff, who
was puzzled by it&mdash;not the less so by reason<span class="pagenum">[276]</span>
of a certain hesitation in the questioner's voice
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"There wasn't any&mdash;any woman with this&mdash;Dan
McGrew?"</p>

<p>"Nope! He's been here three or four times
for a game with the boys. He's square, Dan
is. An' I hain't never seen him look at nary
one of the gals."</p>

<p>Jim Maxwell turned away abruptly from
the sheriff, without a word in parting. The
careless words screeched in his brain, mocking
devils of derision:</p>

<p>"He's square, Dan is."</p>

<p>Jim Maxwell set his face homeward, and
urged the dogs to their best speed, for he had
much to do and time pressed. He reached
the cabin with the first shadows of dusk, and,
after attending to the dogs, busied himself in
collecting important papers, which must be
carried with him, since he could hazard no
guess as to when he might return to the cabin,
if ever. His skins were to be left behind,
though their total value was a considerable
sum. He had put out his line of traps for<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>
the solace afforded by occupation, rather than
for profit from the pelts. He would leave
them with no regret over the loss involved.
He cared little for money at any time&mdash;now,
not at all. The only consideration was that
he must travel fast and light.</p>

<p>With the dawn Jim Maxwell was off. At
the last, he experienced a pang of regret over
leaving this humble dwelling, where, though
he had companioned so long with misery, he
had, nevertheless, found soothing from the
serenity and the silence, and where, in the end,
he had found a daughter and a daughter's
love. But this regret at parting from the
familiar place was, after all, a trivial thing
compared with the desire to hasten from it to
the accomplishment of the work that awaited.
He was obsessed by the purpose to avenge his
own wrongs and those of his children, as he
had already come to term Nell and Jack in his
thoughts. The object of that vengeance was
Dan McGrew. In these hours of pursuit
after the man who had injured him and his
so foully, his mood was all of fierce hatred.<span class="pagenum">[278]</span>
The tenderness that had stirred and wakened
in his heart with the recognition of his daughter
now slept again. A fury of rage filled
him. This nearness to his enemy inflamed
every passionate memory of wrong. Usually
considerate of every creature, he was now
merciless, and sent the dogs forward at top
speed, cursing them when they lagged.</p>

<p>As the day advanced, heavy gray clouds
covered the whole face of the heavens. The
light wind which had been blowing from the
east, veered to the north soon after mid-day,
and quickened. It quickened more and more.
Presently it was blowing a gale. And it came
icy cold from the floes within the Circle.
Jim, under the numbing touch, was compelled
to go afoot oftener, in order to make the sluggish
blood bestir itself. Yet his action was
almost automatic, the result of habit formed
in like experiences. He was hardly conscious
of the changed conditions. Though his flesh
felt the ice-lash of the air and fought against
it, the brain inhibited sensation. His thought
was all of the task that awaited. The chill<span class="pagenum">[279]</span>
of the body was nothing to him. He knew
only the hot wrath that throbbed in his blood.
He gave no heed, even when the powdery
snow came in almost level flight. It was
solely the slackening pace of the dogs that had
power to arouse him. Sorely reluctant, he
gave them a breathing spell, and fed them.
He desired no food for himself. He was sustained
by the spirit of vengeance which was
flaming within him. He was not afraid of
the cold, which grew momently more deadly;
nor of the snow, though it fell so thickly that,
when the journey was resumed, the dogs attained
hardly half their former speed. The
flakes flew in masses so dense that it was difficult
to tell whether the darkness were of its
own making or the night were come. He
could still distinguish the peaks by which he
set his course, and, since he went to his destination,
nothing else mattered at all&mdash;except
that the dogs dawdled. He cursed them
again. His voice went out to them by turns
raucously savage and imploring.</p>

<p>The dogs ran floundering through the snow,<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
which deepened dangerously fast. Ever afterward,
Jim Maxwell believed that, somehow,
the power of righteousness had gone with
him, triumphing in his behalf over the elements
that would have barred his way. It
seemed, indeed, that only a miracle could have
carried him safely through the cold and storm.
He had expected, by unsparing driving of the
dogs, to reach Malamute well before dark.
He himself now had no sense of time, only as
it meant delay in coming face to face with
Dan McGrew. As a matter of fact, it was
ten o'clock at night when his eyes picked out
faint yellow gleams twinkling through the
snow-wrack, which he knew to be the lighted
windows of the Malamute saloon. The dogs
understood that they were come to the journey's
end. They strained at the breast-straps
in a last desperate burst of speed, and then,
unbidden, halted before the door of the saloon
and dropped on their bellies, panting
and slavering. Jim Maxwell with difficulty
stirred his cold-stiffened muscles and clambered
down from the sled. He stood dazed<span class="pagenum">[281]</span>
for a full minute, as if not yet fully conscious
that he had reached the end of the way, that
the hour of vengeance had at last struck.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, Jim Maxwell straightened
himself and squared his shoulders. He
walked to the door of the saloon and opened
it with a steady hand and stepped within,
shaking the snow from his parka as he went.
He halted just inside and stood quietly. At
his entrance, silence had fallen on the noisy
room and the eyes of all were turned on him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p>For a time Jim Maxwell stood there
without movement, blinking confusedly,
while his body drank in the steaming warmth.
The men in the room regarded the newcomer
with frank stares of curiosity. He was unknown
to any of them. They guessed him to
be a miner just in from the creeks, dog-tired
from his fight with the storm. Without being
told, one of the hangers-on of the saloon hurried
out to care for the dogs, since their owner
seemed almost helpless. Very soon, in fact,
a suspicion grew in the minds of the observers
that something more than the cold had affected
this stranger.</p>

<p>"Full of hooch!" was the verdict.</p>

<p>Presently, Jim's vision cleared. He cast
one piercing glance about the room. He saw
Dangerous Dan McGrew sitting at a table
along the wall, a little way to his left. He<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>
had schooled himself for the sight. There
was no betrayal of the emotion that shook his
soul at first sight of the man who had robbed
him of wife and child and happiness. He
even noted with a savage satisfaction something
constrained in the pose of his enemy,
who sat half-turned toward him, a card suspended
in mid-air. Dan McGrew had seen
him&mdash;that was certain. And it was certain,
too, that Dan McGrew would not make the
opening move. Jim Maxwell was content.
His foe hesitated&mdash;and hesitation is weakness.
He had no doubt as to his own strength. He
believed it adequate for every demand upon
it.</p>

<p>He vaunted himself too soon. His eyes
passed beyond the man he hated to the one
who sat on the opposite side of the table. A
darkness fell upon his spirit. He gazed
steadily enough, for he had no power even to
shift the direction of his eyes. There was no
outward sign of the convulsion in his soul.
He remained looking steadfastly at the woman
who had been his wife, at the woman whom he<span class="pagenum">[284]</span>
had loved and lost. None of the onlookers
dreamed that the sight of her meant anything
to this stranger. It was natural that he should
consider her attentively&mdash;she was a handsome
woman, in a place where women were rare.</p>

<p>Jim Maxwell's heart died within him. He
had tried so often throughout the years to believe
that the wife, who had been tricked into
deserting him, had at least never been beguiled
into aught unfitting her womanhood.
Now, he saw before him the damning proof
that she had given herself to vileness, to Dangerous
Dan McGrew, whom presently he
would kill....</p>

<p>But the sight of her dear face! Notwithstanding
all the horror, to see her once again
in the flesh before his eyes was a rapture exquisite,
yet torturing. Her face was the
loved symbol of all his happiness. It was, as
well, the symbol of all hideousness, which had
swallowed up happiness. As he beheld her
thus, ravening emotion devoured his strength.
Suddenly he felt his knees sag. His eyelids
fell of their own weight, so that sight of her<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>
was shut out. The shock of darkness, after
the glory of her face, startled him to realization
of his surroundings and steadied him.
He asserted his will once again. He straightened
and shuffled toward the bar. But he did
not open his eyes until he had fairly turned
his back on the pair at the table by the wall.
Those observing him sniggered and mumbled
again of hooch, when he lurched against the
bar, and clung to it for support as a drunken
man might.... Jim Maxwell was drunken&mdash;drunken
with grief and hate and love.</p>

<p>After a little he recovered some measure of
composure. He drew from his pocket a
buckskin bag, and poured some gold-pieces on
the bar.</p>

<p>"Drinks for the house!" he commanded.</p>

<p>The bartender busied himself in dispensing
this hospitality to the crowd, which surged
forward thirstily at the welcome summons.
The Rag-time Kid, a wan-faced youth with
a cigarette dangling from his lower lip, who
performed noisily on the piano which stood
against one wall, left his instrument and came<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>
forward hastily. Jim saw that drinks were
served to Dangerous Dan McGrew and the
woman opposite him, as well as the few others
that were seated at the tables. He nodded
curtly when the company raised their glasses
toward him before drinking. His manner,
however, was so singular and so remote that
none ventured to address him directly. They
eyed him askance. They speculated among
themselves concerning who the man might be;
for now, in some mysterious fashion, they had
come to perceive that this was not one of the
ordinary miners from the creeks, with the
mud of the bottoms still matted in his beard.
But they could make no definite surmise to
account for him. In some vague way, they
felt the portentousness of his presence among
them. It was as if he stood enveloped in an
atmosphere of tragedy. They looked at him
furtively, confused, wondering, half-fearful,
at his aspect. They no longer deemed him
merely a drunken man. But what he was,
they could by no means understand. They
drank again, for his money still lay on the bar.<span class="pagenum">[287]</span>
They raised their glasses toward him. But
the mystery of his coming remained unsolved,
and it grew more burdensome as minutes
passed, pressing heavily upon their spirits.
Jim Maxwell drank with the others the first
time and the second. He might, perhaps,
have drained a third glass, but, while he delayed,
his eyes chanced to fall on the piano,
for the wan-faced youth with the cigarette
dangling from his lower lip, was still enjoying
his respite and was making merry at the bar.
It had been a long time since Jim had touched
the keys, but now, in the travail of his soul, it
seemed to him that in music he might find
surcease for the warring emotions within his
breast. He went toward the piano, striding
firmly. When he was come to it, he threw off
parka and cap and seated himself and laid his
hands noiselessly on the keys in a touch gentle
and fond as a caress.</p>

<p>As the first soft chord sounded, the pallid
youth at the bar started as if struck. He
wheeled, and thereafter gazed unfalteringly
toward the man at the piano.<span class="pagenum">[288]</span></p>

<p>It had been long since Jim Maxwell had
played. At the outset, his hands moved
slowly, almost hesitatingly, for the muscles
were still a little numb from the cold of outdoors.
But they grew elastic quickly, and a
great series of clanging harmonies echoed
through the squalid room. The others looked
now with the wan-faced youth, whose cigarette
had fallen unheeded. There came the
dainty scamper of cadenzas, a crashing chord,
and silence. The youth, who played himself,
though not like this, understood that the
stranger had made ready. He waited, tremulous
with eagerness; for he loved his art,
although he debased it. He muttered to himself:</p>

<p>"God! how that man can play!"</p>

<p>Jim Maxwell's fingers sought the keys
again, weaving strange harmonies. And
through them ran a thread of melody. The
listeners could not understand, though the
spell of it held them. Only, they knew somehow
that the one who played was a man, full
of a man's passions&mdash;the primitive passions of
love and hate. There was a harshness in the
dissonances that told of bitter sorrows; there
was a charm in the thread of melody that was
all truth and tenderness.

<p class="h5">JIM MAXWELL'S FINGERS SOUGHT THE KEYS AGAIN, WEAVING STRANGE HARMONIES.</p>

<p>Those who heard saw visions, each according
to his kind. In this improvisation, Jim
interpreted his thronging emotions. The
coldness and the desolation of the North were
made audible. Through sound itself, he
made these dwellers in the lonely places realize
again the silence of solitary wastes. The
music cried out in sudden anguished longing,
then broke in discords, like shrieks for vengeance.
Some of the listeners stirred uneasily,
uncomprehendingly, yet thrilled&mdash;for the soul
is more intelligent than the brain. The Rag-time
Kid shivered.</p>

<p>Dan McGrew, the cards of his solo-game
unheeded on the table before him, watched the
man at the piano with steady gaze. His face
was expressionless. He had recognized Jim
Maxwell at first sight, and he knew that the
time of reckoning was at hand. He was dismayed,
for he had come in the course of<span class="pagenum">[290]</span>
years to believe that they two would never
meet. Now that they were met, he was ready
for whatever might befall. But he dared do
nothing to precipitate the crisis. He must
wait to be accused or attacked. If he could
have followed his desire, he would have shot
down the man he had wronged&mdash;would have
shot him in the back, remorselessly, in cold
blood. That he could not do. The code of
the frontier forbids such murder. At such
an act, these men about him would show no
mercy beyond the short shrift of a rope. He
could only await the issue with what patience
he might, cursing inaudibly, so poised that he
could draw at a second's warning.</p>

<p>Lou had not recognized Jim Maxwell on
his entrance. She had given only a glance at
this bearded stranger. She was infinitely
weary of life. She hated this vulgar place,
reeking with rank tobacco-smoke and the
fumes of liquors. She felt, even through an
apathy that had become habitual with her,
shame from the leering glances of these men,
who took her for the gambler's light-o'-love.<span class="pagenum">[291]</span>
She felt herself degraded more and more at
her manner of life and by the associations
thrust upon her. She knew the evil spirit of
the man she had married, which daily and
hourly she was compelled to tolerate. The
life was become almost unendurable. Yet,
she continued the sordid existence, partly because
she lacked the courage to break away
from him, partly because she could condone
the wickedness of Dan McGrew to some extent
in appreciation of his loyalty to her. She
could not doubt the reality of his love for her.
That his love was utterly selfish, she knew.
But he gave her all that he could. The
woman's instinct toward martyrdom made her
feel it a duty not to desert him. Now, after
the coming of the stranger, she felt, rather than
saw, the change in Dan McGrew, and she
wondered over it dully. Not for a moment
did she suspect that her husband's emotion was
connected with the advent of the bearded man,
toward whom she glanced so idly.... Love,
often, is not so shrewd as hate.</p>

<p>Her eyes followed Jim Maxwell as he went<span class="pagenum">[292]</span>
to the piano. She was still listless, wholly unsuspecting
that aught impended. Even the
first softly sounded notes did not arouse her.
It was not until her ears caught the delicate
thread of melody that her heart heard it, and
answered, and she knew that this was the man
she loved. Her hands clutched at her bosom
in a spasmodic gesture. She swayed in her
chair for a moment, then relaxed limply, and
sat huddled in the corner between the table
and the wall, her face ghastly beneath the
rouge. But, lifeless as she seemed, she was
listening through every atom of her being.
In the varying phases of the music, she lived
again the blisses and the torments. And, too,
it was borne in upon her that, as she had suffered
in the years since their parting, even so
had he, who thus wove in sound the fabric of
their lives. Yet, she could not believe that
this man still loved her, though the music that
grew under his fingers was like the talking together
of their souls. A great wonder dawned
in her, a greater fear, still greater hope.
Could it be that the scales had fallen from his<span class="pagenum">[293]</span>
eyes, that he had freed himself from a degrading
passion, that he had returned to his allegiance,
that he loved her&mdash;her! Her body
shook as with a palsy from the riot in her
heart.</p>

<p>Abruptly, the music ceased. Then, in another
instant, there came a series of noble
chords, sonorous and serene. Followed the
tripping dance of arpeggios, which deftly
hinted of a melody to come. The Rag-time
Kid quivered in ecstatic anticipation of something
splendid, nor was he disappointed.</p>

<p>There sounded a lilting melody, a-throb
with the joy of life. The notes rang with the
calls of passion; they trembled into the sighings
of exquisite tenderness. There was rapture
in the magnificent harmonies that
marched with this melody. It was like a
song of two hearts glorious in the fulfillment
of their love, with all the universe chanting
praise of their happiness. It was the lyric of
love triumphant.</p>

<p>The man at the piano raised his arms high,
and brought his hands down on the keys in a<span class="pagenum">[294]</span>
great swoop. The flames in the smoking-oil
lamps leaped and quivered at the devil's din
of the discord. The nerves of those that
heard leaped and quivered. The player got
up from the stool. His eyes swept the staring
faces, and he smiled&mdash;a smile like a curse.</p>

<p>"You don't know who I am, boys," he said.
His voice, resonant, yet softly modulated, was
very gentle&mdash;dangerously gentle the listeners
might have thought, had they known him well.</p>

<p>Dan McGrew knew him well. He understood
that the crisis was upon him. He
shifted very slightly in his chair, that he might
have greater freedom of movement when the
need came. He darted a single glance at his
wife, and saw her sitting erect again, gazing
at the player with dilated eyes in which
showed the hunger of a soul. Dan McGrew
cursed beneath his breath, and did not look
again. Instead, he held his whole attention
on the man who had spoken, and who now
spoke once more:</p>

<p>"I haven't anything to say to you, except
that"&mdash;the voice deepened and roughened<span class="pagenum">[295]</span>
savagely&mdash;"one of you is a hound of hell!
His name is&mdash;Dan McGrew!"</p>

<p>Two shots rang out, which almost blent as
one&mdash;almost, not quite. The crowd scattered
and dropped to the floor. The lights went
out.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p>Word had been sent to the sheriff of
Kalmak of Jack Reeves' capture at
Malamute, and he at once set forth to bring his
prisoner back. He arrived hardly an hour in
advance of Jim Maxwell. He took formal
possession of the accused, and forthwith made
it clear that he was not minded to run any risk
of a second escape.</p>

<p>"That young feller ain't in no way safe in a
jail," he explained to his brother official.
"There's no tellin' what didoes he'd be up to&mdash;he's
that ornery. I'll jest take him along
with me to the saloon over night, an' I'll set
up with him, an' nuss him like he was a
baby."</p>

<p>Despite all arguments to the contrary, the
sheriff had his way, and started to the saloon-hotel,
where the distracted bride had already
established herself. The officer and his captive<span class="pagenum">[297]</span>
were hardly a rod from the door, when
the shots rang out, and, almost in the same
second, the lights were extinguished. The
sheriff uttered an excited exclamation, and
hurried forward with his prisoner. They
were just within the door, when the bartender,
who had so discreetly shot out the
lights, produced new chimneys and leisurely
set the oil lamps going again.</p>

<p>As his eyes fell on the form stretched out
upon the floor near the piano, Jack Reeves uttered
a cry of alarm, and sprang forward.
Kneeling, he caught Jim Maxwell's hand in
his. He could not speak in the first shock of
emotion, for he believed that the man was
dead, who lay there so still and white, with
closed eyes, and the blood trickling from a
wound in his head.</p>

<p>Nell, in an adjoining room, had been
shaken with fear at the noise of firing. But,
in the stillness that followed, she heard a cry
of distress in her husband's voice. She forgot
fear then, and rushed into the saloon and
to his side. The sight of her father there<span class="pagenum">[298]</span>
struck her dumb and motionless with horror.
Thus it came about that she and her husband
were passive spectators of the great heart-drama
that now developed.</p>

<p>There was another in the group. It was
Lou. Before the shots were fired, she had
sprung to her feet, and forward, as if to forbid
the deadly work. She had been too late. But
she had plunged on, heedless of the weapons,
reckless of her own life. The instinct of love
had guided her through the sudden blackness.
So, when the lights burned again, she was there
on her knees, crooning heart-broken words to
the ears that did not hear. She had no
thought whatsoever of that other form which
lay stark, crumpled on the floor by the table
she had left. She supported Jim in her arms,
with a passion of tenderness and mourning;
for she, too, believed him dead, and it seemed
to her that all the misery that had gone before
were as nothing to this anguish over finding
him, only to lose him forever. Then, of a
sudden, Lou gave a gasp of pure rapture&mdash;for
Jim Maxwell had opened his eyes, and lay<span class="pagenum">[299]</span>
staring placidly at the smoke-begrimed ceiling.
She bent and kissed the bearded face,
then raised a countenance that was transfigured.
It was years younger in that illumination
of joy.</p>

</div>

<p class="h5">JIM MAXWELL HAD OPENED HIS EYES AND LAY STARING PLACIDLY.</p>

<p>Nell, watching in startled wonder, recognized
the face in the locket. She knew this
woman to be her mother. She could understand
nothing else. But there on the floor at
her father's side was the mother whom she had
never known. The mystery appalled her.
Yet, a tremulous happiness stirred in her heart
over this meeting, so unexpected, so inexplicable,
so fraught with amazing possibilities.</p>

<p>Jim Maxwell spoke, very low, so that Lou
held her ear close to listen.</p>

<p>"Get it from the pocket inside my shirt,"
he commanded.</p>

<p>"But your wound, Jim dearest," Lou
pleaded. "Don't bother about anything else,
whatever it is."</p>

<p>"Get it!" Jim repeated.</p>

<p>Lou yielded to the authority in his voice,
and searched as he had bidden. She drew<span class="pagenum">[300]</span>
forth a bit of oil-skin, which she opened. In it
was a sheet of notepaper, folded twice, and
worn through along the creases.</p>

<p>"Read it," Jim directed her; and Lou read
obediently, though slowly through scalding
tears:</p>

<p>"I, Anne Weston, confess to tricking Jim
Maxwell and deceiving his wife at the instigation
of Dan McGrew."</p>

<p>That first sentence gave her understanding
of the lie that had wrecked her life. She read
on to the end of Anne Weston's confession, and
knew for the first time the entire infamy of
the man whose treachery had robbed her of
home and husband and child. Hate flared in
her. She turned to look behind her, and saw
the ungainly heap on the floor, which was all
that was left of Dangerous Dan McGrew.
And she was glad!... She turned again to
the man she loved.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Jim&mdash;oh, forgive me, dearest!"
she murmured.</p>

<p>"I've nothing to forgive," was the answer.
"A scoundrel fooled you&mdash;that's all. You<span class="pagenum">[301]</span>
couldn't help but believe your own eyes. But
he's paid at last, I guess. Hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"He's dead!" Lou replied; and there was no
sorrow in her voice.</p>

<p>"And I'm alive!" Jim declared contentedly.
"He only creased me." He sat up suddenly
by his own strength. For the first time, he
appeared to notice his daughter and Jack
Reeves. He spoke briskly now, and his voice
had its accustomed firmness.</p>

<p>"Help me up, Jack," he bade his son-in-law.
And then, a minute later, when he stood
firmly on his feet again, he turned to Lou, and
spoke softly.</p>

<p>"I'm going to make you very happy, to
make up for what you have suffered. And
I'll start by giving you back the daughter you
lost twelve years ago." He nodded toward
the girl, who approached.</p>

<p>"Nell," he ordered, "I want you to take this
lady to your room, and tell her who you are.
Go now, both of you, and have a talk. Jack
and I will come soon. We have something to
attend to first."<span class="pagenum">[302]</span></p>

<p>The women yielded to the masterful air of
the man they both loved, and went away together
to that talk in which there would be
many kisses and the mingling of happy tears.</p>

<p>No sooner were the women gone than Jim
Maxwell faced the sheriff of Kalmak, who,
throughout the excitement, had kept his attention
unswervingly fixed on the prisoner,
with an eye to possible didoes. But before
Jim Maxwell could speak, he was interrupted
by the local official, who detached himself
from the group about the body of Dan
McGrew, and now approached.</p>

<p>"You got him, stranger," he remarked to
Jim, in a congratulatory tone. "And he
mighty near got you. Pretty shootin' by
cripes! And I suppose, Mister, you understand
you're my prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," was the indifferent answer.
"But I sha'n't try to get away, and there's something
I want to have attended to right now.
It has to do with my son-in-law, Jack Reeves
here, who is accused of a crime he didn't commit.
I want to prove his innocence, and<span class="pagenum">[303]</span>
there's a chance I may be able to do it. Dan
McGrew killed Sam Ward. I know it. I
want everybody else to know it. I'm hoping
that somewhere among his things, or on
him, there'll be the proof to connect him with
the crime."</p>

<p>The sheriff of Kalmak protested against the
possibility, and spoke concerning Jack's possession
of the knife-handle. In answer, Jim
made clear the reasoning by which he had
come to suspect his enemy of Sam Ward's
murder.</p>

<p>"And, anyhow," he concluded, "you'd
search this dead man's effects. I'm only asking
that you do it now, and in my presence.
He had the opportunity to do the killing, and
the circumstances must appear suspicious
against him to you, though you didn't know
him for the dog he was. It's an idiotic idea
that this boy of mine, who was on his honeymoon,
would stop off to kill a man he didn't
know, for a pinch of dust he didn't need."</p>

<p>The Malamute official nodded assent.</p>

<p>"You're talkin' sense, Mister," he agreed.<span class="pagenum">[304]</span>
"I reckon Hal Owens thinks the same as I do."
He regarded the sheriff of Kalmak inquiringly,
who found himself exceedingly confused
over this new turn to an affair already
finally determined in his own mind. He
vouchsafed a nod of acquiescence, but ventured
nothing further. "And that being so," the
other went on, "why, we'll just naturally take
a squint at the corpse and his goods and chattels,
and get a line, if so be, on what's what."
Having thus spoken, he led the way to where
the body of Dan McGrew was lying by the
table; and with him went Jim Maxwell; and
Jack Reeves and his guard followed them.</p>

<p>The Malamute sheriff, as became his authority,
made the examination of the dead
man's clothing. He went through the pockets
painstakingly, sorting the articles, and laying
each in turn on the table, while Jim Maxwell
looked on with a close scrutiny that nothing
escaped. But the collection of miscellany
grew little by little without showing anything
in the least significant. No one of the various
objects disclosed could by any ingenuity be<span class="pagenum">[305]</span>
claimed as evidence that Dan McGrew had
perpetrated the crime of which Jack Reeves
stood accused. The hope that had sprung up
in the young man's breast at Jim Maxwell's
utterance quickly died. But Jim himself did
not despair. Sure of his enemy's guilt, he was
sure, too, that somehow it would be brought
to light.</p>

<p>The searcher came at last to a pocket inside
the waistcoat. In it was a tiny book, bound in
paste-board covers. On the outside of the
front cover were printed words and written.
The sheriff gave a glance at these, and shouted
exultantly:</p>

<p>"We've got him&mdash;cuss him!" And then he
added, in a tone of disgust: "And to think
of him carryin' the goods on him like that!"
He handed the book to Jim Maxwell, who
read in a glance, with Jack looking over his
shoulder:</p>

<p>"The Tacoma Savings Bank, in account
with Sam Ward."</p>

<p>Jack's captor, also, who throughout had
kept his hold on the prisoner's arm, read, and<span class="pagenum">[306]</span>
abruptly took his hand away. His voice revealed
how great was the injury done to his
dignity:</p>

<p>"The damn' skunk! An' him a-leadin' me
on! I wish he'd come to life for five minutes,
an' I'd show him that Hal Owens ain't
to be made a fool of." And the sheriff's flashing
eyes and scowling brows showed that he
meant it.</p>

<p>Without a word, Jim Maxwell turned to his
son-in-law, and put out his hand, and the two
men shook hands joyously, yet with a certain
gravity.</p>

<p>"This will be glorious news for Nell," Jack
said, happily. Then the gladness went out of
his face. "Now, we must think about you."
He grinned ruefully. "I'll have to be trying
to do for you what you've done for me."</p>

<p>The sheriff of Malamute regarded the
young man jovially.</p>

<p>"Now, don't you worry a mite&mdash;not a mite,
my lad," he said genially, clapping Jack
Reeves on the back. "We'll have a court<span class="pagenum">[307]</span>
a-sittin' in this blessed saloon in about five minutes,
with a judge and a jury all regular.
From what the boys have been a tellin' me, it
seems perfectly clear that the prisoner just
naturally shot Dan McGrew in self-defense."
He beamed good-naturedly on Jim. "I calculate,
the sooner you're tried, the better you'd
like it, and have the thing off your mind like."</p>

<p>His prisoner smiled in return.</p>

<p>"It can't be too quickly to suit me," he declared.
As a matter of fact, the amiable manner
of the officer, as well as the suggestion itself,
afforded Jim Maxwell immense relief.
Until within the hour, he had had no concern
as to his fate. He had determined to take the
law in his own hands in order to rid the world
of a scoundrel. He had not troubled to think
that his act might involve himself in destruction.
But a change had been wrought in his
attitude. That change had had its origin in
the discovery of Lou. Her presence had
turned his thoughts at the very outset to new
hopes of happiness. He himself had scarcely<span class="pagenum">[308]</span>
realized this, until, with the approach of the
sheriff, he awoke to appreciation of the fact
that he stood in peril of his life. He had not
been able to guess what the mood of these men
might be toward him, a stranger to them, who
had come among them to kill one whom they
did know. Though he concealed it, he had
experienced a considerable trepidation concerning
the outcome. He was gratified accordingly
now over the sheriff's announcement,
which manifested the kindly disposition
of the crowd toward him.... He turned to
Jack.</p>

<p>"Go to Nell and her mother," he directed,
"and keep them away from here. Tell Nell
that your innocence has been proved." As
the young man turned away, half in reluctance
half in eagerness, Jim addressed the sheriff
gravely:</p>

<p>"And now, sir, I am at your service."</p>

<p>The trial was of record shortness, but, in its
way, it was formal, and it had the sanction
of the law. There were no pleas, only the
taking of evidence and the rendering of the<span class="pagenum">[309]</span>
verdict, on which the jury decided without
leaving their places.</p>

<p>The verdict was justifiable homicide in self-defense.<span class="pagenum">[310]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p>Jim thanked the court and the jury for
their treatment of him, and shook hands
heartily with each man of them. As he
turned away, the barkeeper called to him:</p>

<p>"Hey, Mr. Maxwell! There's money
comin' to you!"</p>

<p>Jim went toward the bar, smiling.</p>

<p>"Use it, and if you need more, I'll pay."</p>

<p>He turned toward the crowd in the saloon.
"You're my guests to-night, boys, and I want
you to whoop it up. You're all friends of
mine. Perhaps, I'll look in again by-and-by.
But I must go now. I was alone when I
came here, but, thank God!"&mdash;his voice grew
suddenly husky&mdash;"I'm not alone now."</p>

<p>In the adjoining room, the others were waiting
for him anxiously. As he entered, Jack
sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"They've acquitted you!" he cried.<span class="pagenum">[311]</span></p>

<p>Jim nodded assent.</p>

<p>"I've been acquitted according to the law."
His voice was grave, yet with an undernote
of jubilation. "My conscience never accused
me, I guess. Somehow, it seemed to me that
I had to do what I did. And what about you?
What's your verdict?"</p>

<p>Nell threw herself into her father's arms,
and clung to him. He held her close, inexpressibly
comforted by this contact with his
own flesh and blood.</p>

<p>"As if any one could doubt that you did
right!" she exclaimed, scornfully.</p>

<p>"I've heard the story," Jack interrupted.
His voice was quivering with sympathetic anger.
"Shooting was too good a death for this
Dan McGrew."</p>

<p>"And you?" Jim spoke more softly now,
with his eyes fixed on the woman, who had not
risen. His voice was very wistful. His eyes
were even more wistful, as they searched that
dear face, which, though weary and worn,
was still so beautiful.</p>

<p>The great, dark eyes, brilliant as a girl's in<span class="pagenum">[312]</span>
this hour of excitement, met his in frank adoration.</p>

<p>"Jim," she said, and the music of her voice
seemed sweeter than he had ever heard it before,
"you were right to kill him, of course.
But whatever you do, always, will be right
to me&mdash;just because you do it. I doubted you
once, Jim. Never again!" She rose now,
and came to him. And, at her coming, a feminine
instinct caused Nell to slip from her
father's embrace. Her mother stepped close,
and raised her lips.</p>

<p>"Kiss me, Jim." Her voice was no more
than a whisper, but it went echoing through
all the chambers of the man's heart. He
folded his arms about her with a reverent
gentleness, yet strongly, as if he would never
let her go. Then, he bent his head, and kissed
her on the lips.... It was the sacrament of
a new life in the old love.</p>

<p>Thereafter, the four talked of many things.
Nell was compelled to tell again the story of
her escape from the river. The mother was
deeply stirred by gratitude to the kindly pair
who had rescued and ministered unto her
daughter through so many years. She turned
to Jim, all eagerness, her eyes aglow, her lips
curving in the gracious smile he knew so
well.
<span class="pagenum">[313]</span></p>


<p>"Oh, can't we go to visit them, and thank
them? We must!"</p>

<p>Jim nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, "we must, indeed.
We owe them more than we can ever repay.
We're proud of our daughter, and we bless
them for it. Yes, we must tell them so.
We'll help them in a material way, but we
can never pay them our debt."</p>

<p>"Nell and I," Jack remarked, after a little
interval of silence, "have about decided that
we've had enough excitement for one honeymoon.
We're ready to hike back. What
about you folks going with us?"</p>

<p>Jim looked at Lou, who returned his glance
in kind. The desire of the two was one.
They nodded in silent acceptance of the suggestion.
Then, for the first time in those
many years, Jim Maxwell laughed gayly.<span class="pagenum">[314]</span></p>

<p>"Your daughter can chaperon you, Lou,"
he said.</p>

<p>She blushed like a girl.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, in embarrassment.
"I had forgotten!"</p>

<p>All four, for the first time, were thinking
of the complications that had arisen in this
most curious situation; but a certain shyness
held them silent. It was not until the younger
pair had said good-night, and had gone to their
room, that Lou at last spoke openly of the
thing that was most in her thoughts. It was
now that Jim learned of the divorce granted
to his wife, of her marriage to Dangerous Dan
McGrew. The news stunned him with its
unexpectedness. But, too, it afforded him a
mighty relief. There remained, however,
the astounding fact that Lou was not his wife.</p>

<p>"Why," he ejaculated, "we'll have to be
married over again."</p>

<p>"Yes," Lou assented, in some confusion.
"It's not proper, of course, but&mdash;" She broke
off, regarding Jim with puzzled eyes.</p>

<p>"There's nothing conventional about this affair,"<span class="pagenum">[315]</span>
was the man's brisk comment. "For
that matter, this is not a land of conventions,
of the sort they set such store by down below.
They go here by the right and wrong of things
in themselves. That way is a good deal simpler,
and, in most cases, it's a good deal better,
I guess. By right, Lou, you're my wife. I'll
make you so legally the first minute possible.
It's right I should. Conventions don't
go."</p>

<p>"I'm glad, Jim," Lou answered happily.</p>

<p>"There's the minister that married Nell and
Jack. He'll be there where we're going to
visit Papa and Mamma Ross. Nell says he's
a fine old chap. It would be nice to be
married by the minister that married Nell.
What do you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh, splendid!" Lou agreed, with enthusiasm.
She smiled and dimpled. "Why,
Jim, I saw him. He has such a good face!
Jim, you don't know! I saw Nell married&mdash;my
own daughter, and I never knew it!" She
told the story.</p>

<p>"In the morning, we'll hit a good pace on<span class="pagenum">[316]</span>
the trail," Jim said, decisively, "and get to that
parson as fast as ever we can."</p>

<p>"Yes," Lou said again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The morrow broke fair and warmer after
the storm. The four were off early, with the
whole town turned out to do them honor at
their parting. Afterward, the cheering populace
would attend the obsequies of Dan
McGrew.</p>

<p>The going was slow; whereat Jim Maxwell
fretted hugely. But there was no other flaw
in his perfect happiness, or in that of the
woman who sat with her face turned so that
she might look up often into the bearded one
of the man as he ran behind the sled. Both
were content. Already, yesterday was remote,
with all its loneliness and grief. This
was a new day, in a new life, the beginning of
a happiness that would abide. The sorrows
they had known had cleansed and strengthened
them, and made them ready for a finer joy in
their love. They spoke little together, for
there was small need of words between them.<span class="pagenum">[317]</span>
Neither needed to tell the other of the torment
endured during the years of separation.
Neither wished to remember the evil that was
gone. Why should they mourn when the cup
of gladness was brimming at their lips? The
past was dead. The scars from the old
wounds would remain always. But they
were hidden, and the wounds were healed by
love's magic, and would ache no more. They
set their faces to the future, where life shone
radiant.</p>

<p class="h5">HE POINTED OUT&mdash;OVER THE BROAD-SWEEPING WHITENESS OF THE VALLEY&mdash;TOWARD THE

<p>On the crest of the hill, Jim halted the dogs
for a brief rest. He pointed out over the
broad-sweeping whiteness of the valley toward
the southern horizon.</p>

<p>"Down there, Lou," he said, and his voice
rang with a tender joyousness, "down there our
home is waiting for us."</p>

<p>And the woman echoed very softly:</p>

<p>"Our home."</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
